        "Patient Question": "Me and my ex have been broken up for 2 years now. We met when I was a senior in high school 18yo and he was 21. About 2 and a half years older. We broke up because he had to leave Florida for a job in Chicago after college and I was told that\u2019s the only reason. Our relationship was going good and we both really liked each other but apparently he liked the thought of the job and his potential life in Chicago more or maybe he felt it was just something he had to do. 2 months before he had to move away he broke up with me because he realized he was probably going to move away and he didn\u2019t want to hurt me anymore than he had to and thought it\u2019d be smart to end it earlier than later. I freaked out and basically lost my mind and was beyond depressed until we got back together. He texted me telling me he missed me and we got back together until right before he had to move. Ever since he moved and away and we broke up I\u2019ve been severely depressed and even felt suicidal at times. I basically just feel like my whole life has been taken away and I can\u2019t stop thinking about him. I literally think about him 24/7 and feel an unbearable pain every time I think about him and it\u2019s just too much. Usually people take a bit and get over their ex, but it\u2019s been 2 years and I still would do anything for me and him to get back together. I still think about him first thing when I wake up and last thing before I go to bed and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so obsessed with him. He was just an average looking (to most people) very nice normal guy that was going to college and as soon as I met him I instantly fell in love. I\u2019ve tried everything possible but I just can\u2019t get over him and I seriously need help. This is the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my life and it\u2019s all day every day. Please help.",

But now I feel ready to enter a intimate relationship with someone, however, my lack of confidence and my inexperience have made me very nervous about sex.

        "Patient Question": "As I\u2019ve been becoming older, I\u2019ve been getting into arguments with my parents. But recently they\u2019ve been happening more and more frequently and I\u2019ve been getting more and more angry each time. Each argument has been about the same major topics: my behavior towards my siblings or how I \u201cdisrespect\u201d my parents. But sometimes I can\u2019t help what I say to my parents. If they\u2019re in my face yelling about what I just said or how I forgot to do something, how can I not yell back? My parents say its disrespect, but I feel that they have no respect for me when they\u2019re yelling in my face. But the topic we argue most about is my little brother. He\u2019s 7 and if I do the slightest thing to him he goes and tells and I get the whole \u201cyou\u2019re older and need to grow up speech\u201d. I\u2019m sick of it. I feel that they can\u2019t see that my little brother does things that really bother me, and I\u2019m not being dramatic. Like today, my little brother does this thing where he just touches me. I HATE when he does this because it\u2019s COMPLETELY unnecessary. So I hit him back, not that hard just a slap in the arm. Just so happens my dad was walking by at the same exact time. When he saw this he immediately got in my face, hit my arm (and I had to fight back the urge to hit my dad right back), and started giving me a speech (which during I was completely being a smart aleck because I felt this whole thing was not my fault). When my mother got home I got the same speech from her, but she just didn\u2019t understand how I felt! Then while I was in the room right next to the kitchen they started to discuss what they should do to that \u201cdevil\u201d. But my defense is that my little brother is just very dumb and a wimp and that my parents baby him too much. But to avoid these confrontations I feel the only way to do this is to COMPLETELY IGNORE my whole family. I\u2019ve been doing this by sleeping all day and my schoolwork is suffering, I also barely eat because of sleeping all day. But these arguments always seem to find their way into my life. Is there any way to get my parents to understand me? How do I deal with 7-year-old brother? Can I just keep ignoring them? Please do not treat his as a teenager being dramatic, this is a serious cry for help. After some of these arguments I\u2019ve hurt myself. I scratched my arm with tweezers and today I dug my own nails into my arm. Some of these arguments have resulted in me almost getting smacked in the face by my dad. I\u2019ve also cried for hours before. So please I\u2019m begging for help.",

The more I talked to him the more signs of being a psychopath began to show. He claimed he had no remorse for hurting people. And he said calmly that he thought another kid was going to beat him up (A kid who I know personally would never do anything like that) and so he said he had to kill him. That kind of scared me but I made no comment in an attempt to not discourage him from talking to me. I talked to him some more and I remembered that previously I had heard about some kids thinking that only weak people care about others. So I asked him if he thought that was true and he said yes. I asked him if his mom cared about him (which I know that she does, I\u2019m friends with her) and he said yes. I asked him if that meant she was weak and he said yes. He then continued to say that he would like his mom more if she didn\u2019t fake committing suicide, which from the way he told it, sounding like she was going to commit suicide then stopped because she realized that would leave him and his 4 year old sister parent-less. (His father isn\u2019t in the picture.The reason behind this is unknown. He believes he\u2019s never met his father.) I attempted to explain that she just really cared about him and that she didn\u2019t want him to end up living with people that were mean to him. I asked him if he would like living with people that were mean to him and he calmly replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care. They\u2019d probably have knives and I\u2019d kill them.\u201d I asked if he knew that when people died in real life they didn\u2019t come back to life and he said that of course he knew that. He went on to say that he enjoyed hurting people. I knew that he couldn\u2019t hurt me much so I told him that if he liked hurting people so much he could hurt me. So he hit me then burst into tears.

She was in a manipulative/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted 9 years, and ended recently. She\u2019s been struggling because of it, and I\u2019ve been helping her. She self-harmed, had suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide. When things got overly stressful, she had anxiety attacks where she would convulse(?)\u2013still conscious, barely being able to talk, but her entire body tensed up and standing still, especially her feet and hands. They lasted around 10 minutes, and she\u2019d feel sore afterwards. She\u2019s been getting better, being happier as time passes and able to deal with things better. But just recently, when something that reminds her of traumatic experiences happened, she\u2019d go in a \u201ctrance.\u201d For example, I accidentally said something her ex would say, and she took it the wrong way, as if it was manipulative and blaming her for something I did. She started staring into nothingness. When trying to talk to her, she\u2019d either not react, or barely say anything. When trying to touch her, she\u2019d look very scared and pull away, telling me not to touch her. When asking her to tell me my name, she\u2019d say her ex\u2019s name. When doing nothing, she\u2019d just stare into nothing, staying still. When getting too close, she\u2019d react rashly to get away and tell me to stay away. After a while of trying to snap her out of it, she\u2019d walk away into another room, often the bedroom. Last time, she went to the washing machine, then the bedroom, and told me to stop asking her what my name was, that I always do that, even though it was the first time during that \u201ctrance\u201d that I asked. So she\u2019s at least minimally aware of her surroundings, and the trances may be connected? During those four times, she was unconscious, seemed extremely traumatized, and thought I was her ex. It lasts 15-20 minutes. She snaps back (once after I made her say my actual name a few times, another after I kept telling her I loved her she shed a tear and snap back, the last one after she fell asleep for a couple of minutes) and doesn\u2019t remember anything whatsoever. She feels empty, but in an okay mood, like nothing happened. I\u2019d like to now what\u2019s happening, and if it\u2019s dangerous in any way. Thanks for your time.",

I went to therapy to get rid of this burden but recently something occurred and all my memories are back. I was hospitalized and he came to hospital to bring me home. He got tired of waiting so he decided to have dinner with his friends while I was alone at the hospital. Since my battery was dead I couldn\u2019t call him and I had to go home alone. Not to mention my severe pain and suffering. When I came home, I called him to inform instead I was yelled at because I didn\u2019t wait for him to come back from his dinner which took him so long. His yelling turned into threats, he said he will come to my door and beat me again so that I will regret to answer him back. I can\u2019t digest this. How can someone be so senseless? My therapist said I should not have felt bad about this abnormal behavior because he clearly has mental issues. This doesn\u2019t make me feel better.

Does a person have utter and complete freedom to change his reality or would there always be a faction of his brain leading him to a biased conclusion because of his past experience. For example can a person fully understand and change his reality without his brain affecting that decision based on his past. In other words , a person who grew up in a religion , and changes his religion, can he or she be able to fully accept a new belief and formulate a new truth based ok current thinking and not be influenced by the past. In other words how much control do humans have to truly shape their reality based on their logic and not be biased based on any past experiences or at least not make a decison base on that fully.",

Her family by the way has legally disowned her because she\u2019s not Christian. Like wtf!? Overkill much? Then not to mention being beaten senseless by a group of guys she knows not long ago, but won\u2019t tell me their names because she knows I\u2019d make them eat out of straws. She loves to have fun and drinks quite a lot, but she\u2019s extremely hard on herself, and struggles with accepting failure. She\u2019s also a bit of a bad luck magnet too. And she almost seems to like having her boyfriend never say a single nice thing to her or ever complement her. So she effects this seemingly tough/strong persona on a daily basis. But she, at an increasingly number amount of times, likes to harm herself with thumbtacks. Legs, arms, face, she doesn\u2019t care. And she tells me, \u201cIt\u2019s fine I do it all the time, don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019m fine\u201d. And it\u2019s because she wants to, \u201cfeel something\u201d. When drunk, she often cries and then constantly pleads \u201cdon\u2019t hit me\u201d, even to me! As well as just today I found out she\u2019s into BDSM and has a couple of whips, a gag ball, and I think some leather cuffs or something? Also, she continuously claims that no one cares about her and that her funeral would be empty. And so my main concern is that she has now been thinking about suicide because she feels as though she is unstable, or \u201cfucked\u201d as she put it. She may be right. And I feel as though she simply can\u2019t grasp the fact that, I at least care about her. But aside from that, I\u2019m really just wanting to know what to do, because I am honestly the only person in her life that truly loves and cares about her. And also because she refuses to see or talk to anyone about how she\u2019s been feeling except for me. So pretty much how do I keep my best and only friend, alive and happy? Anything would be much appreciated. Thank you.",

I created a fake stalker in order to get reassurance from others that I am worth something. It\u2019s really just me texting myself. I also use it to ask people stuff about me that I am too scared to ask in person (ex: \u201care you actually her friend or are you faking it\u201d I know logically my friends are actually my friends, but I have awful abandonment issues thanks to my dad. I need this reassurance in order to feel better about myself and affirm that people do actually care about me. I have extremely low self-esteem, as I\u2019m sure you can infer. I have no support system within my family and growing up, I never really had friends until high school. I never want to ask people for reassurance because I do not want to annoy them or chase them away, so the stalker was the easy way out for me. I got pretty wrapped up in being that stalker and definitely got carried away. I texted a person I was friends with as the stalker, but now we are dating. It\u2019s serious and I honestly believe he is the man I will marry. He gives me the reassurance I need when my anxiety is bad and accepts me for who I am so I no longer need that awful stalker in order to function. He is helping me fix the way I think about myself also. I know the stuff the stalker said hurt him because he thought it was hurting me. I am alright with keeping the secret because I do not think he will understand why I did it. I barely understand why I did it. I also do not want to hurt him. I will never do it again. I have no need to. Does creating the stalker make me a bad person? Am I crazy for ever making it up in the first place? Do I need to reveal that it was me all along or can I keep this to myself?

She sleeps a lot and is sad often. She doesn\u2019t answer text messages from anybody, not friends or even family. I have spoken to her because I am concerned about her mental health, and she knows she is sick. She thinks that she has depression, as well as a disorder somewhere between social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder. But she just won\u2019t see a doctor. I have set up appointments for her only to fail in getting her to go- she just refuses and makes up an excuse like \u2018I\u2019m feeling tired\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m busy\u2019. The few times she has set up appointments have been the same- she just doesn\u2019t go.

I can\u2019t afford to have a doctor come to her, and neither can my parents.

I want to be there for her but it is so draining to be the person that she depends on, especially because I\u2019m not a doctor, and she is not receiving any therapy at all.

I personally believe she has gone untreated for most of her life with either schizophrenia or a personality disorder. She could qualify for both under the DSM 5, but I know that is she has schizophrenia she would not have a personality disorder. The reason I am putting all this out there is because she has taken my great grandmother from my grandma, put her name on my great grandmother\u2019s bank account, and is forcing my grandmother to move off her property. She brings up situations that does not make sense because they never actually happened. My great grandfather on my mom\u2019s side was also schizophrenic and I know that it is hereditary. My mother is constantly asking me for guidance and help to understand and decide what to do with her that will benefit the family as a whole. This weekend, November 2-4, 2018, we are planning to move my grandmother and grandfather into our home to get them away from their daughter and off her property. I just do not know what we should do about my Aunt because she needs help, but we do not know how to help her. We have been thinking that we could call DSS, the police, or a mental health facility; however, she is very deceitful and lies a lot. My mother has called the police before because she was putting her children in danger, but the police officer said the only thing my mother could do is call DSS and see if they can find anything. So that did not go anywhere and she still has not received any help. I guess now we are just at a loss for what we can do for her, if we can do anything at all. If there is anything that we are unaware of that we could do, please let me know.",

        "Patient Question": "Does it ever happen that panic attacks (and by extension, panic disorder) develop from another condition? I started having panic attacks about eight months ago with varying frequency and intensity. I\u2019ve never had some of the most common complaints, like feelings of choking or having a heart attack. Mostly I get very dizzy and spacey, along with a panicked feeling of course. It\u2019s sometimes hard to follow conversations or even keep my balance. I\u2019ve also started having blurry vision (akin to nearsightedness) and sometimes cloudy vision. More recently I\u2019ve been getting shaky too. It used to be a slight tremble at most, but now I occasionally have people ask me if I\u2019m alright or comment that it\u2019s not that cold out because I look like I\u2019m shivering. This doesn\u2019t necessarily happen during a panic attack either. Sometimes I\u2019ll be laying in bed trying sleep or driving to work when it happens. I know these things can be symptoms of panic and are common side effects of medications, but they don\u2019t seem to correlate with changes in dosage or starting/stopping a med. In addition, I\u2019m just wondering (maybe even hoping) if it\u2019s not uncommon for people to have panic attacks as a result of other underlying issues. I\u2019m going back to get blood tests done soon (my gp has been on me about it for months, but it\u2019s hard to find a day that I\u2019m both off work and also feeling up to it). Last time I had them done everything was more or less normal, but that was over a year before all this started. I keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way, because like I said, I don\u2019t seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people. It\u2019s also concerning that my prescribed benzodiazepine stops the panic, but a lot of the other symptoms persist (like the blurry vision, dizziness, and extreme fatigue despite it being the smallest dose). Is this something that happens with any kind of frequency? In truth, I\u2019m sort of hoping there\u2019s something else going on that is a little more\u2026 definitive, if that makes sense.

I have been with my husband for 5 years and my step daughter is now 11 years old. A couple years ago, she started to act out and become disrespectful and lazy. We tried everything to discipline and teach her how to be kind and empathetic, but no improvement was made. At this time, we spoke to her mom and step dad and all agreed she should be tested for a disability. Turns out she has Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), but her mom refuses to consider medication or alternative holistic approaches to helping in this matter. My husband has zero legal right in any medical treatments or therapy until she is 16. Long story short, this last summer she started to put herself in between my husband and I when he would show me affection. We put an end to that quickly and explained that we will not tolerate her jealousy or manipulative tactics to separate us. Recently, she told her grandma that she is scared of me. This resulted in a massive fight between the grandparents and my husband and I. We discussed this matter with the daughter and asked if she was truly scared of me and she said she was joking. She has been saying things like this about her step-dad for years now, however we know he treats her very well and there is no reason for these cruel remarks. She has used manipulation techniques like this for a couple years and started by playing the mom and dad against each other. I have done nothing but accept her into my life and have her become like a real daughter. About a year ago, her behavior started to change and she started displaying annoying and selfish behaviors that upset me greatly. She still expects her father to carry her up the stairs to put her to bed, massage her feet, snuggle with him on the couch, pick out her outfits and be in our bedroom without permission.

At this point, when I hear her name, my skin crawls and I want nothing to do with her. The only time I argue with my husband is over her. How can I stop hating, detesting and loathing her? She tried to hug me last night and I couldn\u2019t hug her back. I love children and it hurts me to feel this way about a child. Therapy is not an option for us because her mom won\u2019t approve it.

About a year ago, her behavior started to change and she started displaying annoying and selfish behaviors that upset me greatly. She still expects her father to carry her up the stairs to put her to bed, massage her feet, snuggle with him on the couch, pick out her outfits and be in our bedroom without permission.

I know I have lied but I blame her. When emotions get crazy my behavior is bad \u2013 lying, cheating, drinking, drugs, disappearing. I say I\u2019m sorry and will not do it again. But I do. Just last week I cheated on her. I lied several times about it but she knew Bc she found a condom wrapper in my trashcan. I was emotional, went drinking, and cheated. Guilt is enormous! But I can\u2019t control myself. I\u2019ve lied to her hundreds of times in the past few months even when I have had no reason to lie! Today I was feeling so guilty. I called and we talked. I asked her for one last chance. She agreed to think about it while we are apart for a few days. I\u2019m going on a quick out of state trip. But she caught me in a lie there as well because I went with a platonic female friend. I told her that I was going with a couple of guys she knew. She called while I was driving and I had to admit I was with the female. She said that\u2019s it; she\u2019s done. I\u2019m so guilty and heartbroken. She\u2019s my whole world and she is the only person always there for me. But I keep treating her badly. Over Christmas I took several hundred dollars from her bank account to buy Christmas gifts. I told her I had something nice planned for her and her daughter. I spent all that money on drugs in one day! Then I lied and told her I didn\u2019t it on an exirnduve gift for my mother. Of course, she caught me in that lie! You name it and I\u2019ve done it to this woman. She deserves none of it! I want to be with her but I can\u2019t keep myself in check.

Symptoms included hearing voices (inside my head, not outside), occasional visual hallucinations, self-injury and suicidal ideation. Each voice had a name and their own personality, and not all of the voices were negative. They interacted with each other and also with me. I was put on a high dose of risperidone and symptoms began to decrease, and I stopped seeing a psychiatrist. I am now 17 years old, and recently, I\u2019ve been having inner dialogue going on between my own consciousness and two voices that are not created consciously by me. I am female and they are both male. One is the same age as me and one is around 19 or 20 and they both have their own names and personalities, similar to what I experienced when I was younger. Now, however, I\u2019m noticing that I\u2019m becoming more and more forgetful of what I\u2019ve done and sometimes what I\u2019m in the process of doing. For instance I\u2019ve received classwork and exams handed back to me with my name on it that are written in different handwriting that I don\u2019t remember doing. My friends will ask me if I remember something we talked about yesterday or even earlier the same day and I won\u2019t recall what they\u2019re talking about. Sometimes I\u2019ll be in the middle of doing something and I suddenly forget what I was doing and have to ask my friend what I was just talking about. However, at times, one of the voices will say \u201cOh yeah I remember that!\u201d or they\u2019ll say \u201cwe were in the middle of doing this,\u201d most of the time being correct. I\u2019m concerned and confused about what\u2019s been going on. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m having another psychotic episode and I\u2019m delusional or if I might have signs of DID.

First he wouldn\u2019t call me, he would prefer to go out with his friends than me, he wouldn\u2019t even remember the day of our anniversary, or things like that we kind of tried to work all that out but I\u2019ve always felt that he really doesn\u2019t love and care about me, even though he says he loves me. Also he has lied to me during this time, first once he went to a party and when I asked him if he did he lied to me in my face. What bothered me was the fact that he had pictures dancing, almost rubbing himself, with another girl. He lied in my face when I asked! After that we had trust issues and I told him that he would need to help me out to solve that and he said yeah, he would make me trust him again. Months later I found out he is talking to a girl over the internet and he even met her and when I asked him if he knew her he said no again, lie to me in my face looking at my eyes. After that he went away in a trip and disappear for the whole trip without trying to reach me and also told me that his phone didn\u2019t have coverage there, that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t take it\u2026(another lie!) after all that I broke up with him\u2026I think he doesn\u2019t respect me because he is always adding girls on myspace and trying to meet girls\u2026we meet 5 months after we broke up and now he is asking me for a second chance\u2026we had sex once after the breakup, I think he only looks for me whenever he wants to have sex\u2026I still have feelings for him that\u2019s why I always end up accepting whatever he says but I know it is not good\u2026 What do I do? Should I give him a second chance or just forget about him? He says he is gonna make it up, that he has change an that now he is more mature but he had lied and hurt me so much that I feel that I love him but I have some anger towards him for making me cry so many times\u2026.why do I keep getting back with him every time he does something that hurts me? I Feel that I can get someone better, someone that would make me happy and don\u2019t hurt me that much\u2026but I don\u2019t know why I keep going back with him.",

        "Patient Question": "I was fine until 7th grade ended, and then its like my memory jump skips to constantly being worried and miserable. When I was going through 8th grade I reached a point were I decided to work on what was bothering me so I could be better, but thats when I realized I had no idea what was bothering me. Looking back before all of this started though I\u2019m not sure if I ever was fine, when I was younger I never considered any other kids to be my friend really, a lot of adults though. I did eventually move to a place were I kinda grew comfortable with everyone, and while I used to consider that time to be the peak of my life, looking back there were still flags then to. Im not exactly sure when, but between 2nd and 5th grade I developed maladaptive daydreaming, and while I felt fine for some reason little me felt compelled to feel emotional pain, I used to purposefully seek out depressing content to put myself in a bad mood, I honestly still kind of do this. During this time I developed a crush in which I became obsessively and honestly kind of creepily attached to him which drove him away from me in the long run,(this repeated in 7th). Anyways after 5th grade I moved away from that place to somewhere else, I got adjusted and made new friends and everything seemed fine until 7th grade ended. Going into 8th I originally had hope, I hoped I go back and I\u2019d fall back into the old groove of things and everything would be fine, but when I got back it was just more issues. I didn\u2019t trust anyone, every time I was with my friends I just felt alone, and I figured they probably wanted me gone so they could actually have a good time. My anxiety, (that was previously nonexistent), was at its peak, i\u2019d have shooting pains, hypnic jerks, and would frequently fall into states of depersonalization/derealization. I finally came to the conclusion that the way to stop hurting, was to stop caring. I\u2019d repeatedly tell myself, \u201cI don\u2019t care about anything, I don\u2019t care about anyone\u201d, in hopes that I would believe it, I\u2019m not sure if that had any effect on me, but after 8th grade ended I just stopped caring. I still had symptoms of anxiety and depression, but they were no longer manifesting themselves into physical symptoms. I still felt unwanted by my group of friends so I just stopped hanging out with them. I wouldn\u2019t say I felt happy, but I wasn\u2019t miserable, I was just kind of done I think. Going into high school I still didn\u2019t really have any friends because I was to scared to talk to anyone, and when they made an effort to talk to me, all I could think in response to there advances were one word answers. I started to grow more fearful of the future as I realized that my childhood was running out and I had no idea what I want to do with my life. I know people say \u201cpursue a career in your interests\u201d but nothing interests me. If I could truly do anything in life, I\u2019d find a secluded area from everyone so I could listen to music and be alone to my fantasy world. I guess that\u2019s kind of were i am now, done, and fearful of the future. I can recognize that not all my thoughts are correct and 90% of the bad things that im convinced everyone feels about me, are probably caused by my anxiety, but even being actively aware of that I still don\u2019t feel any different. I just hope that someday I can be normal, I fear that all I\u2019ll have to remember my teenage years, is me sitting alone in my room listening to music. I wish I could go to social outings and take risks, and have new experiences, and I realize for that to happen I have to take the initiative, but everytime I get handed a chance to do those things I shy away from them because in the moment that all sounds like a terrible idea to me because I much rather be left alone, and its not until later that I regret it.

He pops into my head at weird times. Sometimes, he will pop into my head and suddenly he will appear. I was driving a road close to where i live and he popped into my head. The song playing had nothing to do with love, all of a sudden his truck passed by. It was just me and him on that road (I live in the country so there aren\u2019t many busy roads) and all i could think was why did it have to be him? of all the people who live here, and when he is on my mind he passes me. so weird. Anyway, when I started sophomore year at the end of August last year, Jack was in one of my classes. we got assigned seats and he got put next to my best friend and i got put across from his best friend. the way our desks are set up are sideways from the board. If he wanted to look at his friend who sat across from me, he would have to back his chair to see around other peoples heads to be able to look at his friend. As soon as we got assigned seats, i would catch him looking at me. I figured he was looking at his friend but whenever he would actually look to his friend i noticed him backing his chair up to see around other people. He never backed his chair up and we made direct eye contact. It would be like 5seconds until i turned away. happens in the hallway too. I would catch him looking. I talked to him a couple times in that class but i was so nervous. 2017 is new so i decided to add him on snapchat. I was so nervous and he added me back. We talked for a couple weeks until all of a sudden he would leave me on read. It broke my heart. Now he will sometimes reply but still the random thoughts and appearances of him occur.

Worst of all I hate everything that is breathing, heck I hate object too. Today I thought to myself I hate everything, but jokes on them I hate myself more. When i sit by myself thinking anything other than school, I like to think of anything that has made me feel like a bad person. I have to drown it out with music or podcasts to drown out my thoughts. I have trouble sleeping during the night without videos. I used to cry to make me feel better but sense being deemed a cry baby by other and myself, I stopped. I barely smile, but when I do its fake. I fake laugh more. My friends don\u2019t treat me like another person, casting me aside for others. I have this one friend Lara and she is the nicest ray of sunshine and she is so nice, but i get jealous and envious of her happiness. Another reason why I hate myself because I cant cut myself, I\u2019m too afraid of my parents saying \u201cyou only have one body that God gave and you should respect it\u201d, if i hear that one time I swear I will scream. My mom hates me, and says how I\u2019m a brat when I talk back to her. My dad is the scariest person you will ever meet when he gets mad (the only time I cry is when Im with him). I play a sport and I used to love it but know I am learning to hate it like everything else. I\u2019m too dumb to get into college for Knowledge I want to leave the stupid state that I live in and live somewhere were nobody knows me and they don\u2019t have any ideas of who I am. Like I want to be someone else who isn\u2019t me with my stupid problems. That don\u2019t even amass to the problems that other people have to deal with. The only person I truly love is my sister and she is gone at college. I can only see her on the weekends sometimes. I feel like a waste of time and only think that the future will worsen and I will never find love or a decent friend. Hopelessness=Me.",

I have always felt like the relationship between me and my parents has gotten slowly worse with age and I feel like there\u2019s this power struggle going on with my dad mainly. I don\u2019t know if I am to blame, if there\u2019s things I can do to improve on the relationship other than sit and just avoid any contact with him, which hasn\u2019t worked or just bend to every rule he makes. He has this very aggressive, controlling nature, using respect as a weapon against any lack of discipline towards him. I respect his house and his rules to a degree, but he makes a lot up as he goes and uses respect, or what he calls lack of respect, for him as a way to manipulate any situation to make me feel like I\u2019m the one in the wrong. I have grown up with the notion of respect being a two way street but also to respect your parents, however I have never respected my birth mother due to her complete lack of human empathy towards anyone other than herself. However I have always respected him, to an extent feared him and it\u2019s been that way for years however I can no longer deal with the sheer stress of living with this and he refuses to acknowledge when he is wrong and believes I am so arrogant and stuck up when I believe I am right when standing up for myself against him. I don\u2019t know what I can do to improve the situation. He\u2019s a good man, he\u2019s always looked after me and taken care of me as any parent should however he has such an aggressive, controlling attitude to everything in his life that it\u2019s just getting to a very toxic point in our lives. However I am the one being blamed for it and not him as well, which makes me depressed and think that maybe there is something wrong with me that I just don\u2019t realise so I really don\u2019t know what to do in this scenario.",

My other friends actually sat me down to tell me they thought she was genuinely in love with me, but I thought they were just being dramatic. She has always been a little nuts (yelling at guys she doesn\u2019t like, getting belligerently drunk, etc). I thought she was just a lot of fun and I didn\u2019t mind be friends with someone a little out there. Everything changed when 4 of my best friends (including her, who was my best friend at the time) got an apartment together. It\u2019s too hard to explain so let me just list things that have happened and are happening: \u2013 she screamed at guests we had over for being too loud and insulted them when she could have just asked for quiet (by the way she is the loudest person I know) \u2013 Recently, we had to take her to the emergency room when I got a call from my friend saying she was unresponsive and needed to go to the ER. When I showed up she started yelling to everyone to fuck off and to only let me near her when I wasn\u2019t even the one at the time helping her \u2013 We went out one night and she got so angry at me for not wanting to go to the same club as her that she yelled at me in public \u2013 Every time I go out with her she drinks so much that I have to follow around and take care of her ALL night \u2013 she tells every person she meets that I am her best friend and that we are attached at the hip \u2013 She spent over 1k on me both my birthdays even though anyone who knows me knows I would NEVER want that \u2013 she constantly talks about how we will be each others bridesmaids \u2013 she follows me around for entire days and nags me constantly to hang out with her \u2013 she gets very jealous and angry when I have other friends. She has straight up bullied my new roommate since she moved in She has had an extremely hard life and I feel so guilty but I can\u2019t do it anymore, help?",

        "Patient Question": "Basically, I was extremely happy with my boyfriend for months and then we went on a holiday. On this holiday, I met his cousin and my boyfriend and I supported him at the time as he was going through friend issues. Consequently, my boyfriend became closer with him and so did I \u2013 to the point where we started introducing him to our friends that my boyfriend and I mutually share and are very close to. A few months later and the cousin has really been disrespectful towards me \u2013 he has been rude etc. Or thinking he can talk to me or treat me a certain way. To the point where it has caused me mass anxiety. Now, my boyfriend feels in the middle and I just want things to go back to the way they were before the holiday where he wasn\u2019t involved so much in my life (I see him every weekend through the friends I\u2019m close to). My boyfriend does not have it in his nature to cause conflict and therefore leaves the conflict and has not stood up for me. I have reached a point where I feel as if I cannot be with him unless he supports me and stands up for me. For example today he was at a braai and it was obvious I was clearly uncomfortable about him and I\u2019ve made my boyfriend aware of this \u2013 yet he would laugh with him and make jokes with him while I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. This is my boyfriends first relationship. Also, he is very emotionally manipulated \u2013 he gets scared of this cousin if he makes plans that the cousin isn\u2019t invited to (like will he freak out scared) . I just want him out of my friend group and to see him as little as possible like a family member and not a close friend. I want to hope that maybe , he will even cut ties as much as he could with this person after seeing how badly he has treated me. I just want my number one person to understand that family shouldn\u2019t be this involved in your friend group etc. And I want to feel like he\u2019s in my corner.

A month later, he brought another woman into my home and proceeded to be sexual with her while another of his friends was visiting. There is something wrong with me that this would go on. This is the same woman, I think. I didn\u2019t see her, but I heard her and she sounds the same as the woman my ex was with. She\u2019s broken my windshield, she tormented and injured one of my cats, she\u2019s stolen from my purse, she\u2019s stolen my house and car keys, she\u2019s TORMENTED me. My ex denied denied denied. He called me crazy. When packing up\u00a0his things, I found a pair of airline slippers under his nightstand. They were small \u2014 a female size 7 or 8, slim. I also found baby monitors with power cords. I actually broke down and hid a video camera outside. It recorded her climbing in our bedroom window with my ex\u2019s help.

I have no one I can trust. I tried to be a good woman. Why has she focussed on me like this? Is it fun? I never could get a name, of course, so I can\u2019t get an anti-harassment order or anything.

        "Patient Question": "I know there have been many in my situation, but I have yet to find a submission that has presented a clear answer to help with my situation. In October 2009 my wife found out I was cheating with a co-worker. I did not feel comfortable telling her all of the details at first so I continued lying as I felt I was protecting her already fragile state. I have been a liar since I can remember and I don\u2019t know how to stop. I realize I personally make the decision to lie every time I do it, but that doesn\u2019t seem to get in the way when it comes down to making a decision whether or not to lie. We have severe financial problems and will more than likely lose our home. My wife has told me we won\u2019t be married after she graduates from nursing school but we haven\u2019t separated yet because we have 3 children together and she doesn\u2019t have an income. I have been getting payday loans to subsidize my income and have paid a significant amount towards those loans to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. So goes the lying. I get loans my wife doesn\u2019t know about to keep things normal and she always finds out I have been getting money somewhere and I end up telling her the truth. She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I\u2019ve done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn\u2019t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I\u2019ve done. She has made comments in the past that she would \u201cstab me\u201d and she would \u201cget off\u201d if she were to kill me (because I cheated). I know what I did to her was terrible and I feel like a terrible person every day. I live in a manic world to keep myself from going off the deep end. I have been told I can\u2019t leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately. I told her about my fear and she got extremely angry, told me I was selfish and started crying because that statement meant I didn\u2019t care about what I put her through. The fact is, I didn\u2019t know how to help her. I let myself get in the way a lot since she found out and she wouldn\u2019t let me provide comfort when she was in pain. I have never, nor will I ever inflict harm on her, but I fear her statement are true and the mental anguish I have caused is the reason she cut herself some this past year and almost overdosed on drugs. I am writing this because I want to stop lying. I am writing this because I want to know how to get out of the situation I am in without a huge legal mess. I love my kids; I love to be around them. If I had my choice I would never leave their sides. I can\u2019t, however, feel like I am a good parent for allowing them to live in the environment I have created. My wife has not recovered to the point where she can get out of bed at a decent hour and function with them. For months after she found out she would sleep most of the day while they were left to fend for themselves. I didn\u2019t know what to do because I feared I would lose my job and make things even worse. PLEASE HELP!! Or, help me to find a good counselor in my area that accepts my insurance. I can\u2019t afford to pay the co-pays all the time so that has kept me from going. The last counselor I had fell asleep in the chair while I was talking.",

But he has always been very mature and well-spoken for someone his age. Recently we have been experiencing a lot of downfalls in our relationship. He has a very busy schedule and doesn\u2019t make a lot of time for me. We are also long distance, he lives across the country. I\u2019ve been asking for some time to video chat and discuss over some of our issues and he agrees that we should do that as well, but he has not prioritized time for me. I\u2019m feeling very insecure in our relationship because lately when we fight, he doesn\u2019t seem to care. One minute he is expressing how important I am to him and that he loves me. And then the next, he is getting defensive and said that I\u2019m not being considerate and understanding. During our 6th month together, we had a big fight which led to me breaking up with him because I was frustrated with him. He ended up getting drunk that night and told me he kissed one of his female friends. It took me awhile to forgive him and to move past it, but I feel like the feeling of betrayal never really left. He told me he would never do something like that to me again and that it was something stupid that he regrets so much. But I feel like anytime he gets upset with me or we have an argument and he goes out with his friends, I fear he would hurt me again. I don\u2019t know what to do. He isn\u2019t giving me much to work with because I can\u2019t seem to be able to get him to sit down long enough to talk. If he isn\u2019t going to class or studying, he\u2019s working. And that\u2019s almost 7 days out of his schedule packed. What do I do? I love him so much and I want to work past this, but I just feel so defeated. (From Canada)",

I live with my mom who is a single parent. I do have an older sister who\u2019s 23, she lives in the downtown area of my city though. My mom is an alcoholic. She\u2019s pretty ok when she\u2019s sober. She\u2019s annoying though, but whose parents aren\u2019t? But when she drinks, she becomes horrible. A complete replica of Dr. Jekyl and Mr.Hide. She becomes verbally abusive. I know its only words, but, they hurt. Deeply. And kind of sensitive but I don\u2019t show it. It reminds me too much of when I was elementary school and used to get picked on by this one boy. I\u2019d cry when I got home. But when she drinks, she calls me \u2018stupid\u2019, \u2018whore\u2019, \u2018bitch\u2019, and any other name in the book. She makes me feel like utter trash. She becomes physically abusive also. She\u2019s slapped me before, pulled my hair, choked me. But now that I\u2019ve become older I fight back, words and fist. I\u2019ve beaten her with her own crutch, beaten her in the head \u2019till there was a gash. Actually this just happened not too long ago actually. My left cheek still has a slight scar from when she scratched it about last week. I get so angry at her whenever she tries to tell me she\u2019ll change, and that she\u2019ll get better. I get angry because I know its a complete lie, and I despise getting lied to. Its happened too many times to me. I\u2019ve gotten so emotional and angry that I punched a hole in the door of our bathroom door, and another time when I was angry I threw a glass cup at the wall and a hole is now there too. I get angry at any other thing too. Sometimes I feel like screaming and pulling my hair out. Many times I feel insane and crazy because of that. I\u2019m a \u2018cutter\u2019 I\u2019ve cut myself multiple times due to the depression,sadness,and pure hatred I feel. I\u2019ve wanted to commit suicide by either hanging myself, or over-dosing on pills, any kind. At times I feel bipolar because I can change my emotions quickly. I don\u2019t know what to do.

At what point do I stop trying to repair the damage? She has admitted the affair. She\u2019s stating that she no longer speaks with him, but I question that. She is still very guarded of her phone, still friends with him on Facebook, etc. The reason she started the affair, and I\u2019ve taken responsibility for this, was due to the fact that I put my work and mainly my hobbies ahead of my family for most of my marriage. I always thought she was supporting me in my hobby, but she says she was very unhappy.\u00a0 And looking back I can see that now. Wish I had seen it then. However, she never told me point blank how unhappy she was. I found out about how unhappy she was about 3 months ago. I made wholesale changes in my life. I dropped my hobby right away. Starred spending as much time at home as I could. I put her and our daughter where they should have always been, first in my life. But something still seemed a little off. Then about 6 weeks into trying to work on our marriage( me doing most of the work, which I was fine with) I found out about this emotional affair. It devastated me. So now, another 6 weeks has passed. Things haven\u2019t gotten much better. She says she\u2019s done with him, but I question that as I said. I am still trying very hard to fix my mistakes and prove I\u2019ve changed. However, I don\u2019t feel she\u2019s doing the same. My question is, because of my failures which I feel lead to the affair, should I be willing to give her more \u201ctime\u201d to get to the point of working on her issues? It\u2019s very difficult for me to handle the constant secrecy with her phone. I want to take it and see if she\u2019s still contacting him, but I\u2019m afraid that will crush any progress we may be making. I still love her very much and I do want to work this out. But at what point do my feelings and concerns become part of the equation? Thanks. (age 37, from US)",

I work full-time and I guess I started to be jealous of his schedule, being able to be home, etc. Since he had so much time, he started to play computer games again (used to play them 24/7 as a teenager) which also included joining some online forums. In July I discovered that he was talking to multiple girls online (sexually and romantically) and that he joined forums such \u201clooking for relationship\u201d etc. He told me he had only talked to one girl (I saw conversations with multiple women) and only because she had mental issues. After that, he stopped talking to them online, yet still kept playing video games. He was supposed to find a new job since his PT job slowly stopped making him any money, yet he wasn\u2019t able to (or didn\u2019t even try) find one within the past 6-7months. He plays his computer games around 10 hours a day, goes to bed at 3-5am pretty much every day, spends money (that I\u2019m trying to save) on his games and ignores everything around the house. Whenever I try to confront him about something he gets very upset, calls me names like \u201cb*tch\u201d \u201cidiot\u201d and just yells at me. Whenever I find out he lied to me about something it\u2019s the same \u2013 starts to yell at me, starts to throw things, hit himself, calls me names and sometimes blames it on me. Then he always apologizes and tells me how much he loves me and that I\u2019m his everything. Now he is supposed to go back to school starting in two weeks, but every time I asked him to show me his log in, schedule or just something, he gets upset and his log in magically doesn\u2019t work.I looked at his school email and saw many emails from his school counselors telling him that he was late to sign up and can only sign up for summer semester at this\u00a0point. He also lied to them why he dropped out of school a year ago and said it was because of his dad\u2019s illness (even though his dad is perfectly fine).I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to since I moved from a different country to be with him.",

        "Patient Question": "So to start off my mom and I didn\u2019t always have a terrible relationship. I think things started changing when I started, well, gaining weight. I was becoming fat and she used to scream at me for it. In the beginning, whenever she did call me fat and ugly she apologized later and this continued till I was like 13. She did hit me with a rolling pin or her hands\u00a0and I used to be so scared to walk past her when she was in a bad mood cause I was afraid she\u2019d hit me if I was in her reach. I remember this one time I was on the ground and she was kicking me and just kept going. Then as the teen years went by I was in that typical unreasonable stage where at one point I told her I hated her which got me a quick beating. When I finally passed that stage when I was 17 and I didn\u2019t get beatings anymore. I also started making effort to drop the weight however she never tried to support me, like she\u2019d pay for the gym, she\u2019d push me everyday but the moment she was in a bad mood she\u2019d call me a fat and useless daughter, which really hurt my feelings cause I was genuinely trying to lose weight. She told me everyday if I kept being fat I\u2019d get bullied and in my mind I always felt like she was my only bully. Every time i spoke to her, she\u2019d sort of look at me in disgust and say, \u201cGo away I don\u2019t really need to look at somebody who looks like an elephant at this time of the day\u201d or she\u2019d call me a useful lump or something like that. She is slim and beautiful, of course. I stay locked in my room because I know if I come out and have a conversation it would turn to the topic of my weight and end in a fight.\u00a0 She has a problem with that as well and has called me dull countless times.",

However, I noticed a few changes in my behavior and im not quite sure what to make of them and i had to stop seeing my therapist, Im seeing a new one soon, but im supposed to discuss gender identity problems so i dont think that is the right place to discuss this. Basically im very paranoid and at first it seemed to all be related to social anxiety like i would convince myself they all hated me and would delete all my social media and hate them for supposedly hating me (for something as silly as not answering a text) but i got in trouble so im fairly isolated now and only have myself to talk to. But when im driving im always looking to see whos behind me and what they might be thinking and if theyre following me and ill go 40 in a 25 just to get away from someone and im overly suspicious something is up and theyre followng me or thinking bad things of me somehow.I also have depersonalization and derealization issues and when it gets bad i convince myself that the reality im trapped in doesnt matter anyways and that i should just focus on the reality i create for myself in my head. Im also more religious lately? Ive always been agnostic but now I love Jesus a lot and bought a crucifix to hang on my wall from a thrift shop which isnt an issue but im just worried because my grandpa and uncle were both schizophrenic and im 17 and these are supposed to be early warning signs but i dont want to jump to conclusions of course.

He has received counseling for being a peeping tom 17 years ago. Yes he peeped at my daughters. In case you need to know, he never touched them, he watched from afar. They are now in their 30\u2019s. They hate him. He has mellowed and is regretful. He has said he is sorry to them twice and would get on his knees if he thought it would help. Two months ago we started \u2018hanging out\u2019, going places. I did not tell them because I was just seeing him and not asking them to engage in any form of relationship because I knew they would not want to. About two months ago they figured out that we had gone out of town for the night. They sent me terrible texts and threatened not to speak to me again if I didn\u2019t not stop seeing him. I have continued to do things with him because we are so happy together. He seems to have truly changed. I understand that time will only tell. We are not getting married or even including them in the time we spend together. Neither of us remarried after we split up many years ago. We have both been very lonely, not the type to jump into relationships. So now I am torn up inside. I will be miserable if I cannot keep my friendship with him but my stomach stays in knots because I have now been excluded from my family.

I\u2019m an eighteen year old girl whose very confused about herself and had to grow up way too fast and just keeps her problems to herself because no one will understand, I know you would like to get to the root, so I will just get to the point. 1) When I am in a bathroom, I feel someone is going to come out of the stalls and kill me. Also, if I am an elevator or a large hall by myself, I begin to feel pressure in my face and body to the point where I have to put hands over my ears like a child and is paralyzed. However, when I see another person, I instantly am better, the pressure is gone and everything. I have been like this for a long time. My mother laughs and just think I am acting like a little girl. But I know that their is something wrong here. Whats up with that? 2)I am very socially weird and growing up I heard sex is just something that will damn you to hell if you do it, because you get pregnant. In high school I was a virgin and did everything perfect and didn\u2019t want to look bad in the eyes of the lord or others. However, my hormones would kick in. SEX!! I couldn\u2019t stop the feeling. I needed it like air. When I would make out with guys, a weird sensation would happen and I would breathe heavily ( not like I am having an asthma attack or anything I was just fine) and just tremble like I am gasping for air. Even when I thought about it too much it would happen either before or after I would make out with a guy or even think about it. 3) Lastly, I have voices that talk to me in my head. There is eight of them inside of me. They all have names and personalities of there own. Bobbi is the bad one and he makes me want to hurt other\u2026just impulses to kill someone or just choke them. Phoebe is a sexual predator and will want to kidnap someone to make them her personal play toy\u2026.the others are harmless but enhance my mood to their personality. But when I am stressed they tend to take over.",

He has no other family members, in town, other than his two adult sisters that moved into an apartment together 10 minutes away\u2026. however he cannot stay there because they recently had a baby and the boyfriend is living with them. his parents continuously put him down and tell him how worthless he is, and how they\u2019re kicking him out the second he turns 18. He says he just wants parents who ask how you\u2019re feeling, say i love you and how your day was\u2026 but he has never had that. he comes home to drinking and smoking and screaming. This past week he has started his first job, working for a contracting company doing under the table work like hanging dry wall and packing mud, he is really exited to be making money and i want to help him figure out a savings plan so he can move out when he turns 18. im sorry this is so long, i just wanted to tell you the whole situation, and i just want someone to give me some advise on how to help him move on from his parents and love himself. It tears me apart to see him go through this, and know this is all hes ever known.",

I\u2019ll do crazy and spontaneous stuff because of it and I\u2019ll also get heavily paranoid. I got put on antipsychotics because I was having hallucinations, paranoia and delusions. I don\u2019t have mood congruent hallucinations, paranoia, delusions etc\u2026 I have done my research but I refuse to self-diagnose. During these episodes I am not aware I\u2019m acting out of the blue and I have been told by others I have disorganized speech that I jump from topic to topic. Why is any of this happening? I\u2019ve abused drugs (amphetamines) in my past and I had grandiose delusions of being the most intelligent person that was gonna be a big thing. When I went off of them I finally had a psychotic episode and it went untreated until recently. I no longer abuse drugs and I \u2019m pretty healthy. Why is this happening? Some paranoia seeps out even with medication. My hallucinations are mainly: Walls moving, whispering, shadow people, random lights, letters moving around on phone, or this bloody girl. Delusions: Paranoid that I\u2019m being monitored by a group of people through brain communications, or thinking people have been replaced by imposters",

        "Patient Question": "Since I can remember, I\u2019ve always thought of myself as unattractive. At school I was considered undesirable and teased indirectly about my looks. In my later teens men started taking an interest and I became sexually active and happy, eventually entering my first relationship which lasted 4 years. This relationship ended about a year ago and though I am over it, my ex dragged out the ending and it became quite bitter with another woman involved. He would openly compare me to her and make comparisons and refused to kiss me but also would not end the relationship and have very unemotional sex with me \u2013 as though I were an object. He began making direct comments about my lack of attractiveness and eventually I left. A month or so after that, I slept with one man after a date in a dark room. Since then, I have been unable to be naked around myself or others. I cannot look at myself in the mirror and my sex life has completely stopped as I can\u2019t be intimate unless the room is pitch black, I have clothes on and I don\u2019t know the guy. It\u2019s been almost a year since I last had any sexual contact with anyone and it\u2019s upsetting me greatly. I worry I won\u2019t ever be able to be naked or intimate with anyone again. The problem has progressed \u2013 I have always been nervous of spending time with just one person unless I know them extremely well as I fear awkward silences or general awkwardness. This has merged with my inability to have sex as I also fear being alone with someone I intend to have sex with: what would I say? What do we talk about? What if there is nothing to talk about? I miss being intimate with others and there have been multiple times I could have engaged in sexual activity or perhaps formed a relationship on one occasion but I can\u2019t discuss this issue with anyone other than close friends and the distress it causes me knowing I won\u2019t be able to have sex leads me to push potential sexual partners away. I decided to seek help on here after tonight, 2 separate men I know I can speak to alone, came to my room to ask if I\u2019d like to sleep with them and both times I panicked and was unable.

The real problem is I seem to be missing something. I\u2019m too\u2026open-eyed, I guess. I sit around with a stupid smile on my face. At school, I feel uncomfortable if people try to sit next to me at lunch, so I sit on my own and read, and this doesn\u2019t bother me at all! But my mother thinks I\u2019m hurting myself (socially), but she doesn\u2019t seem to understand how strained I feel when I\u2019m put into a situation I don\u2019t like. On the other hand, when I do feel chatty, I always seem to mention topics that aren\u2019t related, or I steer the conversation towards me, or I\u2019m unintentionally mean. I try to remind myself not to behave that way, but every time I talk it seems like I mess everything up. I think about things no one else really cares about. I\u2019m not sure if my personality is weird or if something is actually going on with my brain that doesn\u2019t happen with everyone else, because even introverts (i think) have their own little group of friends to sit with, even if they don\u2019t talk, but I feel stifled and nervous when I haven\u2019t started talking on my own terms. I\u2019ve started noticing that I take nudges and pushes a little too seriously, and when I try to replicate that playful atmosphere with my siblings I end up hurting them or angering them. Everyone gives me a hard time because of it. My siblings make me feel guilty. Once I had politely declined an offer from a nice girl who wanted me to come and sit with her and her friends, and when I later on related it to my mother, she was upset that I didn\u2019t accept the offer and told me that I wasn\u2019t going to make many friends if I was rude like that. There\u2019s also the fact that I act a lot like a child and can be loud and annoying, and I feel like I interrupt people all the time.

Nothing was too alarming until 3 days ago he received some messages, went outside for 1h and when he came back, he started talking to people that weren\u2019t there, yelling, than talking quietly, and it was like he was hallucinating. At one point he even changed his personality. At hospital they said that it was brief reactive psychosis (f23. 9) and gave him clozapine and risperidon, and some other medication that i don\u2019t know. Since then, he did sleep, but he still talks, quietly, but still does.What do you think how long is this going to last? When will he stop talking?

She got dumped after a week and he started seeing someone else from the group and i believe they are still together and happy, which is great. My ex was vulnerable, afterall it was a healing group.

Had they gone on and had a relationship i would stand back and be happy but we both feel so much worse and the lessons are vague. i told him my worst fear and he made it come true. he said he just reflected my fear in his action which is just the sort of garbage i would expect from him now i know his ego and intentions took over. if i thought he was a predator i would write something on his healing forum but i would have to back up my story which means going public with our names. he offends my sense of decency and has caused me so much emotional distress. i know i have to forgive him for my sake but there is acceptance and there is acquiescence, which means i will accept it but need to protest. do i let it go or dig it all up?",

        "Patient Question": "Hi. I wanted to know if there could be something wrong with me, and if so, what could be causing it. For quite a while now I have been experiencing extremely intense mood swings and identity shifts that only last for a very short period of time. One minute I can feel suicidal, the next I feel euphoric, the next I am bursting with energy, the next I am rage full, and the next I feel like a rational human being. However, I have found that when I\u2019m in these euphoric, energetic moods I can become extremely paranoid if triggered. The other night I slept over at my friend\u2019s house in one of these moods, and the voices inside of my head said that if I didn\u2019t throw my phone at the wall, something horrible would happen. So I struggled with it for a while, and then finally threw my phone at the wall. All my friends who were trying to go to sleep woke up. These voices are not audible they are just two voices that seem to be there and tell me to do things, but they contradict one another all the time, and often I can\u2019t figure out who to trust. I\u2019ve felt pretty stable for a little over a week now, except for last night when I thought that my mother was trying to poison me (lately I\u2019ve been feeling more and more that my parents are trying to kill me). I had a small panic attack and then I got over it. I also started planning out how to kill my friend, but then changed my mind. I become very angry and murderous at times but still seem to have a capacity for intense empathy for others. The confusing thing is, whenever I switch back into my rational mode I view my past actions as ridiculous and try to forget about them. Rational mode can last for a week or so, maybe longer, and then I go back headlong into a tailspin and let everything fall apart. I know that I am not schizophrenic because these voices are not audible and I still have a pretty good grip on reality. I also know that it is not bipolar disorder because the moods change far too quickly. I am very confused, and would appreciate a little guidance. Thank you in advance!",

We are desperate for help since this has been going on for over 15 years. My 31 year old stepdaughter has had drug problems for 15 years &\u00a0 just up & left yet another rehab while on Vivitrol. She goes into detox hospitals and then gets transferred to residential recovery houses, which she stays at for a couple weeks then up and leaves and then loops through this process again and again.

She doesn\u2019t seem to have reasons for leaving any of these places. Though, she acts very immature and does seem to struggle with authority and taking responsibility for anything. She has been in trouble with law, and while once she cared very much for her looks, she now has covered her body in tattoos. She has a young daughter, who she OD\u2019ed in front of (she no longer has custody) & parents who are desperate to get her help and finally get her on the right path.

I had a really positive idea that could help the world and fear they may come after me for working on it. I quickly dropped that idea too. Now when Im reading tweets I read them a little too quickly and my brain changes words around. This only happens with tweets and when Im stressing about going schizophrenic (almost 24/7now) Ive started having nightmares about my worst fears Anytime I get scared I think ima paranoid schizophrenic now. I\u2019m always scared my thoughts will turn into delusions I fear any low noise that might mean Im hearing something None of this has gone on for more than 6months. Am I losing it? PS I smoked a lot of marijuana prior to the anxiety attack",

        "Patient Question": "Hello! I\u2019m struggling for now 4 years without telling it to anyone. I\u2019m just not happy and I\u2019m done feeling like this. I always thought that that was just a phase and it would go away with time but everything got worse when I entered middle school, I started having strong body image issues, I even got an eating disorder for two years. But since summer 2015, I kind of controlled this eating disorder and I\u2019ve been eating \u201cnormally\u201d since. But throwing up every time I was eating was my way to feel like I was in control, but since I tried to recover from it, I feel like I have nothing in control, so I found this feeling of control in self-harm but my anxiety got even worser. It became so unhealthy that it has an impact on my physical health. I\u2019m not trying to get a diagnosis but just some advices on how to talk to my parents (that know absolutely nothing about it, they just think I\u2019m someone very nervous) even if I know that it would tear them apart to know that I self-harmed and how bad I feel. Or is there a way to make them subtly understand that something\u2019s wrong without directly going to them? Thank you very much for reading this!",

        "Patient Question": "Ok so I am 16 and in my last year for secondary school and my school life has been fun as i have enjoyed my life so far, but since April my mum has stopped dropping me by car or picking me up by car from school so i now travel by bus, so one day on the bus i was listening to music when my mind dosed off and i started to fantasise about killing the passengers of the bus in very grotesque ways such as running there face between the tyres of cars so that there face rips off their skull and just look like a pancakes and then i would feed it to the passenger next to them and i also do something grotesque to them, and its come to point where i enjoy it, and now i can just think about it and do it to any one i want whether it be family members or class members i really have no remorse so the ways which i kill them are bloody and unreal. I do not suffer from any sort of depression, (when i searched for this question, most people had been suffering from depression or had thoughts of committing suicide which i have not yet) and i do not have any problems against the people that i think about killing it just that it makes me happy killing in my mind. I have not told anyone so far as they may laugh at me (which i would also do), i am not sure if this is something normal or if this is something i should worry about as it may lead on to much worse thing but currently i do not believe that i will complete or act out these thoughts as it is illegal and against my religion but who knows something might click and even that may not stop me. All I asking is should i tell anyone, or should i just leave it be and not act on it, and what actions should i take (also i have come to being fascinated by surgeries which involve needles and knives and also murders which involve a lot of blood and i have not played video games in a year due to exams creeping closer so i do not think that that is the problem).

        "Patient Question": "When I was 14-17, I lived with a physically and verbally abusive step-father who constantly insinuated that I was gay. I didn\u2019t know how to stand up for myself then. I remember a particular night, waking and feeling barely aware, as if I\u2019d been drugged, and unable to move. I actually don\u2019t know if this is, in fact, a memory or if it was a nightmare, but it was very realistic. I was in my room, in my bed, and every detail about the room is there. I distinctly remember seeing the hallway light and this man my mother was married to standing at the door. He comes into the room and forces oral sex on me. All I remember is gasping for air and being unable to move my arms. To this day, 18 years later, I\u2019m not sure if this experience was just an awful nightmare or if it is a memory. During this time, I also began suffering from sleep apnea and have had trouble sleeping since then. My life has generally been stressful since those years for various reasons. For example, I learned last year that I have seizures in my sleep (in addition to the daytime ones that began 10 years ago). I\u2019ve done pretty good at not letting myself feel like a victim, especially since I have confusion regarding the past. But I have always wondered if I was drugged and raped as a minor. And if this is why my life has been stressful, why I seem to lack self-confidence, why I developed epilepsy and sleep issues. I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. Should I try to unlock any buried memories? Should I just shrug and bury the whole thing, move forward and all that? Will any of this help me better address the stresses I have? How important is it to resolve this? I am being treated for both the apnea and the epilepsy.",

        "Patient Question": "Hi! I\u2019m 22 years old and for the past year and a half of my life I have been in a never ending cycle of self-loathing. I think firstly it is important to understand that I\u2019m not the type of person to ask for help. I rarely do even at the most minimal of levels. So it goes without saying that this is, in a way slightly uncomfortable for me. That being said let me address the issue at hand. For the last year and a half I have been experiencing feelings that confuse me. Feelings that until now I have yet to express to any other person, including close friends and relatives. My issue is this, every single and I mean every single thing that I do that is not done to perfection I beat myself up about. I\u2019m not talking about when it happens but in the future. I\u2019ll be watching TV, driving a car, walking down the street and Bam! Out of nowhere a negative thought, embarrassing moment, or otherwise distasteful event will pop in my head. For the next 30 seconds to a minute it will consume me from the inside out. At best I\u2019ll clench my fist or jaw and maybe shake my head. At worst I\u2019ll have to lay down and take deep breaths to overcome it. Whether the event was a lie I told years ago or an awkward encounter I had with a close friend that if I asked they may not even remember. It\u2019s a constant war in my head. On one hand I can realize that 99% of these past events just don\u2019t matter in the bigger picture of life but on the other i\u2019m a perfectionist and they are just unacceptable things that drive me insane. This has lead to strong anxiety to the point that If I\u2019m having a episode in my head I may slur my words while I\u2019m talking to someone. Furthermore it has lead to a hatred for myself and a deep sadness. I have been loved by so many people and can\u2019t explain why I feel the way I do. But the churning in my stomach has to go. It is just to unbearable. Thank you very much for your time.",

But recently I started seeing things; shadows, faces, demons, and a lot of house cats that aren\u2019t there when I go near them. I occasionally hear voices, mostly people yelling at me, but the hallucinations are more common. I\u2019m so paranoid most of the time. I feel like I\u2019m being watched or followed. I feel like there is someone outside of my bedroom door right now. I have a small TV in my room and I can see my refection in it from where I\u2019m sitting. Something is telling me that\u2019s not my reflection and it\u2019s a supernatural creature watching me. I refuse to eat food that wasn\u2019t made by myself because someone could\u2019ve poisoned or spit in it. I tried to lay next to my mom earlier (she realized I was having an anxiety attack and wanted to hold me), and she had her arm around me. Something in my head, not a voice but a feeling, told me she was going to dig her nails into my back and rip out my heart. I got up and ran into my room without saying anything. Also, whenever I\u2019m outside or in public, when I hear someone laughing or talking I feel like they are making fun of me. I don\u2019t trust anything. I put paper over all cameras on my all my devices. I feel like the government is watching me. I thought I could have schizophrenia (my great-great grandma had it), but all the stories I read, people which schizophrenia seem to not be aware that something is wrong with them, although I am very aware something\u2019s not right with me. Pretty much everyone in my family has anxiety and depression. My brother and cousin have struggled with anorexia and my mom is bipolar. Should I get help? My mom thinks I\u2019m clairvoyant.

I get easily upset and angry, but especially with my mother.\u00a0I dont know how to deal with things and i dont want to break things, so i end up clenching my fists or pushing my nails into my arm or even biting my self hard just to not break anything, i\u2019ve hit myself in the head many times just to try to get rid of my anger, im hurting myself and i dont want to do that, but i just cant control it. Im to afraid to go to someone who can diagnose me or help me since i know my family would be disapointed, and it would be really bad for my younger brother.

        "Patient Question": "My boyfriend and I have been \u201ctogether\u201d since August, but on and off since we broke up 3 times. He has these constant feelings of insecurity, self doubt, feeling the need to compete (he visited me after work and said he was better looking than any of the guys there, for example; and today he was upset that his best friend was poking me on Facebook, and it made my boyfriend insecure). He overthinks really bad, gets really stressed out and handles it the wrong way. Two weeks ago he got really stressed and asked if I wanted to break up. Of course not. He\u2019s been cheated on and betrayed and he knows friends and family who have also been betrayed in the past, so I get that he will have trust issues, insecurity, maybe even a hint of jealousy (or a lot of it?), but I think he may need help. I\u2019m not sure. I love him, and when he\u2019s not being upset, we\u2019re fine. But he gets upset a lot; today he said he wasn\u2019t eating because he felt \u201cdown in the dumps\u201d. That worries me because over a year ago he was dealing with something else, and stopped eating, and went to a mental hospital. He said that after taking antidepressants, he eventually felt better and he hasn\u2019t dealt with that issue again. The issues in our relationship have to do with him; he always says it\u2019s him, something he needs to deal with, etc. His insecurity, overthinking, self doubt, lack of confidence or trust in anyway, the way he views the world so negatively and always expects the worst possible outcome, etc. Today he said he wants a break. I highly doubt a week-long break will cure this; I don\u2019t want to insult him, but I\u2019m not sure how to say that I think this is something he probably needs to speak to a professional about, and not deal with on his own. His negative thinking and overthinking is causing him far too much stress and though he\u2019s been feeling like this less (or talking to me about it less), it\u2019s making him feel worse. This is the first time he\u2019s told me he hasn\u2019t been eating and that worries me. I love him; what do I do?",

My fiance has been out of town the last few weeks so I am alone in the house. After several minutes of panic, I convinced myself I was hearing things and went back to sleep.\u00a0 Next, I was dreaming and then awoke to someone in bed lying next to me (spooning me) I said my fiance\u2019s name several times and the person put their leg over mine, pinning me and grabbed my hair pulling it firmly. I laid perfectly still for awhile until I realized I no longer felt the presence and then confirmed no one was there. I thought maybe I dozed for a second and the person must have gotten up and was in the house elsewhere. It\u2019s now a few hours later and I am still in my bedroom.\u00a0 As daylight is coming I am feeling safer. I am certain I must be hallucinating but it was SO REAL. I have never done drugs in my life and I am not on any medication except for 2 days ago I took 1 Zyrtec and used flonase for the very first and only time for allergies.\u00a0 I saw an allergist about a week ago because of allergies and chest pain with shortness of breath.\u00a0 I tested positive for the pollen allergies and do not have asthma. I suffered from PTSD in the past due to death of a child 7 years ago. I had hallucinations at that time where I believed I had witnessed my husband getting out of bed to answer the door and talking to people before coming back to bed.\u00a0 When I asked him about it the next morning he said it never happened. Again, it was so real. I may have had a very small stroke about 15 months ago as I went for several days without being able to write my name though everything else seemed ok and I eventually was able to write my name again after several days.\u00a0 I never saw a Dr. regarding that incident.\u00a0 I am overweight and have slightly high blood pressure but do not take any medication.

I fast for days and I refuse to eat foods that I deem as \u201cbad\u201d.

I will study until I can no longer see words clearly on the paper or the screen, which some people might think is a good habit, so I am not exactly sure about this particular case.

The thought of actually going through with it doesn\u2019t scare or distress me; quite the opposite, actually. I think it would be a lot of fun.

There aren\u2019t a lot of ways to research \u201ckilling without getting caught\u201d so I figured I\u2019d try to figure out how to not kill people instead. I\u2019ve never actually killed anyone, if that matters. I\u2019ve killed animals, and it was pretty nice, but never humans.\u00a0I can\u2019t quite describe why I want to kill. When I think about it, I feel like have a reason to live. I\u2019ve never been suicidal, but I also feel detached, as if I am living my life just because I have nothing better to do. When I think about killing, that changes. I feel glad to be alive and I can\u2019t wait act on the feelings. But I think I shouldn\u2019t, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m submitting this question. So, how do I stop wanting to kill people? And is there something else that could make me feel the same way? I really like the feeling, and there isn\u2019t much else that I like, so I don\u2019t want to lose it. (age 19, from the US)",

        "Patient Question": "I was molested by my stepdad at age 13. I was sick (stomach bug) and my stepdad asked if I wanted to take a bath. I said yes, but did NOT consent to being undressed and bathed by him. He just did it, and I was terrified. My mother knew that this happened, but not that I was molested. I told my guidance counselor at school about the bath, but also failed to mention what else he had done. CPS came to the house, but nothing came of it. I finally worked up the strength to tell my mother that I was molested when I was 19, in addition to all the perverted things he has done/said throughout the years. The most disgusting thing I recall him saying happened at age 12, a year prior to being molested. He said &\u201dif you were 18, I would leave your mom for you.\u201d I nervously laughed, trying to disregard what I had just heard. Despite telling her everything, she is still married to him and has shown little to no concern. I came forward three months ago to every family member of mine and my stepdad\u2019s that I have in my contacts. I have an 11-year-old brother that my mother had with my abuser, and after coming forward to everyone (which she was aware of) she claimed that she wanted to speak with a professional before making any decisions. She\u2019s trying to justify her lack of action with the potential effect that leaving his dad may have on him. I have not spoken to her since coming forward. When my older brother spoke to her last month, she blatantly lied by saying that I spoke to the professional she supposedly saw. She even said that this \u2018professional\u2019 told her that nothing she does will be good enough for anybody, and that I may have some kind of delusional disorder. I suppose what I\u2019m trying to ask is how I should handle this disaster. I\u2019m absolutely devastated. My mother and my stepfather\u2019s family have completely sided with him. It\u2019s hard to effectively describe how soul-crushing this is to somebody that hasn\u2019t been in a similar position. All I know is that I\u2019m in desperate need of guidance.",

Before I got pregnant we were into alcohol and weed and clubs and we lived the fast paced city lifestyle. After I got pregnant, I decided to change my life for the better, cut off bad influences, and become a sober parent for my son especially since I know the pain of growing up with drug-abusing parents. My child\u2019s father hasn\u2019t changed any, and he says he doesn\u2019t want to.. not even for our son. He says because of things that happened in the past, he loves me but he doesn\u2019t trust me and he believes after I have my son I\u2019ll go back to my old ways and that my changes are an act. He texts other women in my house, he barely talks to me, and he makes me feel unappreciated in every way. Because I didn\u2019t have a father in my life growing up.. I\u2019ve been trying to keep him around for my baby but, I\u2019m starting to have second thoughts on whether this is more beneficial than it is harmful.. I don\u2019t know what to do.

I had two childhood friends who I used to spend most of my days with since the second grade. After the transition from middle school to high school, they both have found different groups of friends, and I have lost all connection with them. I have found some substitutes for them, a group of people who I used to go to the same middle school with. I never really talked much with them until I had class with them. To this day, I would not really consider them friends, but more of acquaintances. I mainly just used them to have a group of friends to hang around with during lunch time. Around my sophmore year, I had detached myself from everyone in my school. I am just alone on my phone during lunch time, I don\u2019t really talk to many people, the only time I do talk is when I am required to. I have looked into the Avoidant Personality Disorder symptoms, and they seem to line up perfectly with my personality. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t talk to people because they won\u2019t like me for being boring. I just sit home all day, mostly do independent activities all day like programming. The only friends I have are people I have met within the programming community. The only people I would feel comfortable around are the people who I feel I have some form of superiority over.I think the main cause of this is from my sister. She has talked down to everything I ever thought or have done ever since my early child hood. Everything from the music I listened to and even made fun of the types of friends I had at the time. I have confronted her with this and told her how I think this is the main reason for my mentality of being unaccepted by everyone, and she had stopped putting me down for everything for about a year now. The problem is, my social life doesn\u2019t seem to be getting better. As I go through my senior year, it seems to be getting worse. I just need some beginners advice on what to do before this problem becomes permanent. (age 18, from US)",

I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but whenever I am sitting, or standing near a male (unless they are in front of me) I feel extremely uncomfortable and anxious. I think I felt this way a bit earlier on in high school, but in the past year, it has grown worse. I am always trying to make sure that I am not sitting next to a guy, and once one does sit next to me, I become paranoid and cannot focus on anything but what he does. Every move he makes. And if he sneezes or coughs, I jump out of fear. The worst part is that they know I am watching them, I know they do, because multiple awkward times, guys have asked to switch seats. I can\u2019t stop it, and with some guys, it is worse, but in general, the more a guy fidgets the worse it gets. I don\u2019t understand why I feel the need to watch them, and I dread the classes where I know I will have to sit next to a guy in. I just want to know what is wrong with me, and if there is anything I can do to stop it. I feel the need to look away from them, or use my hair as a curtain to shield me from seeing them out of the corner of my eye.

He is a wonderful person and my best friend, but as we are starting to consider getting engaged, I am finding myself very concerned with the negative aspects of our relationship. He is bipolar and not medicated and is not seeing a counselor. He is unpredictable and volatile. One day can be amazing and another I can be afraid or so frustrated I want to just leave. Lately I have found myself looking at other men as potential partners and I feel like I am cheating (even though I have not acted on anything). We have fought about this one issue in our relationship for 4 years, about him not being open about his disorder but blowing up on me and expecting me to just sit back and take it, with no confrontation. I feel that he is not maturing or growing in this relationship. While I love him and genuinely want to grow old with him, I am fearful that this is not intelligent of me to do, nor practical to marry someone who is bipolar and seeking no treatment. What can I do? I have tried talking to him in multiple manners from different angles and he always blows up or hides in himself. I have seen a therapist about this issue and I am still so confused.",

When I look at people\u2019s mouths, I tend to have an erection, and I feel kinda excited about it.

Sometimes I would just weirdly (?) ask my classmates to open their mouths, and they would usually do it, and I would get really excited and I would erect. Is this a normal \u201cfetish\u201d?

We started being friends shortly after he stopped being friends with another guy (named Alex for privacy). Alex basically (from what i\u2019ve heard) was a terrible friend. He started ignoring David, lying to him, saying mean things,and even ruining other relationships to be closer to David. I feel like these experiences for David have traumatized him where he is always bringing himself down for every little thing he does. Everything he does is wrong. This, in turn, means everything that I do correct. This makes it extremely hard to be open about things in our relationship, which i think is needed for a healthy relationship. He places me on a pedastool for everything, and I cant feel comforble with that. I know that he is also right in his own way, and its healthy to compromise. I feel like we cant compromise because i am always the right one no matter what. I\u2019ve been getting overwhelemed with it and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I feel like anything I say will make him feel bad about himself for the next few months. Whenever I bring up something, he shuts down and can\u2019t say anything. I usually feel like I just caused a mental breakdown, as he has had a few in the past. He does have a therapist, and has had one for 2 years.

        "Patient Question": "My name is S\u2014-, and I\u2019m 19 years old. For most of my life, I\u2019ve been experiencing urges to kill people. And not with guns or anything like that either. I want to slice them open with a knife, taste their raw flesh, and watch the light leave their eyes as they die. If people on the street knew what I was thinking about doing to them, then they\u2019d probably be horrified. Fantasizing about this sort of of thing really arouses me sexually, and while it\u2019s not the only thing that does, it\u2019s possibly the best. These urges don\u2019t only occur when I\u2019m upset or angered, but those emotions definitely amplify them. For example, if I\u2019m just standing there with something sharp in my hand, I\u2019ll have the impulse to just thrust it into the soft throat of the nearest person. I would just love to feel it sink in, and get covered by the blood gushing from their wound. I\u2019d probably cannibalize their body, too, because I love the smell and taste of blood. When I was younger, I would cut my arms just to taste the blood and rub it on my face. I\u2019ve never actually killed anyone, no matter how much I\u2019ve wanted to, but I a did stab my neighbor\u2019s dog to death once. It just made me feel so alive, like nothing else ever had, to feel it\u2019s fear and watch it die. Now that I\u2019m writing this all down, it\u2019s making me sound like some kind of deformed, basement-dwelling freak. But I\u2019m an attractive person, have a sizable amount of friends, loving parents, and a beautiful girlfriend. She\u2019s the real reason I\u2019m writing this; I\u2019m absolutely horrified by the prospect of her finding out what I\u2019m like. I don\u2019t want her to be afraid of me, but she\u2019s too sweet to not be. I haven\u2019t \u201cgotten help\u201d yet because I\u2019m still living off of my parents, and I haven\u2019t even told them I\u2019m a lesbian yet, much less a psychotic cannibal.

Now that I am back with him, she blames me every single day for choosing to ruin my life, she blames me for causing her pain and she blames me for my family falling apart. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m scared to go home due to the criticism I\u2019ll have to face from her. She bases her opinions of my boyfriend based on some text messages she read, because she literally stole my phone and figured out my password, she crossed the line and invaded my privacy. She is now making me choose between my boyfriend or them, and honestly if she thinks that my boyfriend is the one hurting me she is very wrong, I love her very dearly but now the only one causing me pain when I\u2019m already feeling helpless is her. The other day she even ran away from my house for a straight two hours making me worry, and when she came back she threatened me and my 14 year old sister saying she was going to leave us because she\u2019s tired of living in this stupid country with two daughters who are a disappointment who use her and don\u2019t appreciate her (AND THAT IS NOT TRUE)",

I hear a voice telling me that if I do not do a particular ritual, I will die. (I also have phobias and general fears). As I have had OCD for many years (since I was 11 years old), I believe I can more or less deal with it. However, in recent months, I have experienced new voices. They are telling me that I do not love my boyfriend. They do not require any kind of ritualistic behaviour and therefore i cannot make them go away. I constantly have 2 different thoughts and i argue with myself all the time in my head. 'Could they be a different form of OCD? or could it be some form of schizophrenia?

Since my junior year of high school, I have been experiencing something that is hard to sum up in simple words, so I will do my best to describe my symptoms. As far as the memory can stretch back, I have always had difficulty remaining positive and maintaining focus. I am forgetful and often lose track of conversations that I participate in. Lately, my issues have evolved. My sleeping and eating patterns have changed, I am increasingly irritated and angry, and I am begininng to make poor life choices as well. I also feel generally depressed by the state of the world, often finding myself lost in thoughts that seem to be existential in nature, but more relative to my surroundings rather than myself. My self-esteem is either very low, or about that of a normal individual. I have begun to experience periods of blinding aggravation and anger, as a result, I am lashing out at those around me. I have never been like this before and I am beginning to feel as though I have some form of mental disorder that is beginning to surface, or at the very least, it is becoming more announced. My childhood seems to be what is on my mind the most these days, that and well, my current state. I come from a background of poverty. I was raised by a single mother who has done her best despite her faults. For a period of six years me and my sibling experienced domestic abuse from her previous boyfriend, ages 8 to 13.

        "Patient Question": "My life is currently a disaster. I understand other people have it worse. Physically, I am blessed. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, transportation, a supportive family, an amazing church, and a helpful therapist (who is both a mental health counselor as well as a drug and alcohol counselor) who truly seems to care. During a very recent hospitalization, I also began utilizing a journal to get my thoughts out in a private manner. I have an incredible support system I rarely utilize. I am struggling with a number of issues. I suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self harm and drug use. I am an alcoholic and a drug addict who attends AA meetings regularly but have yet to pick up my 24-hour chip. I feel as if I\u2019m not ready to surrender and work a program. I am, however, terrified of the consequences of alcoholism/drug use. Another fellowship I was previously a member of states these consequences at the start of every meeting: jails, institutions, and death. I lost one of my best friends in March to addiction. I have also seen many others lose their lives. While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence. I am in such a conundrum. That is the only word I can think of to describe this mess known as my life. Following the worst inpatient experience of my life, I am also struggling with the emotional pain of being on a very small amount of numerous medications. I am on the starting doses of these meds which have not nearly reached a therapeutic level. I feel as though I am mentally and emotionally unstable, as is proven by my recent words and actions towards others. This has caused others pull away, possibly permanently. I owe amends I\u2019m not ready to give. As a member of AA, I believe in the ninth step. That is a step I struggled with a lot, though. There were a lot of repeated amends by mouth, but no changed behavior. It was unintentional lip service. I was and still am unsure of how to change my behavior. My next issue has to do with the job I just lost on Monday and the rest of the issues I haven\u2019t discussed that were a result of this volcano that has just erupted. A few weeks ago, I put my two weeks notice in at a job I had worked at for three weeks shy of a year. I was burned out on working with the general public, so going back is not an option. I had just been offered a contracted cleaning job. So for my last two weeks of work at my old job, I worked both jobs. This was not a good decision. I was simultaneously feeling suicidal due to just being put on Latuda. I could not get ahold of my psychiatrist, so after just two weeks of working a brand new job, i found it necessary to go inpatient before I made a fatal decision. Following being inpatient, they told me at my new job that while I had been out of work for two weeks, they had to fill my position. I burned bridges, lost my sponsor as a result of using the day they let me go, and cut myself for the first time in two years. I feel too unstable to try to obtain and maintain employment at this time. I will not be able to pass a drug test at the moment. Not having a job leaves me with a ton of time on my hands. I am torn between applying for SSI and SSD and looking for a new job (in a few weeks.) This leaves me with no income. I am blessed to live with a parent who provides for me. I don\u2019t really understand the point of sharing all of this. I am the one who needs to make some changes and decisions.",

I considered him my best friend, lover and partner I know he is my soulmate as I\u2019ve never felt like this before \u2026 he was my first and only love. He graduated before me and we had a long distance relationship visiting each other and always talking everyday for 6 years . It wasn\u2019t easy at all \u2026we went through a lot during that time \u2026 he had several manic and depressive episodes and I recognized all the symptoms. He has been medicated for years but every time the episodes occurs he would break up with me and breaks my heart. It happened at least once a year during our relationship and I always reached back. I always fought for us even when it\u2019s painful and hurtful. I believed in him and us with all my heart and wanted to be there for him to support him We talked about having a future together and we were getting engaged. We are both from different countries \u2026 but it didn\u2019t matter at all since they are neighboring countries. He talked to his mom and told her about us she wouldn\u2019t accept me cuz I\u2019m from a different country he told her how I understand him and supports him but she still didn\u2019t care \u2026 in his culture he can\u2019t fight his family to accept us. He can\u2019t force me on him even thou there\u2019s nothing wrong with me except being from a different country. He tried for several months until he started to hate his family and to resent them and he broke up with me few days ago saying we don\u2019t have a future after 6 years he breaks my heart and shatter it into pieces. He has been experiencing some mood swings during that time feeling pressured \u2026 frustrated and overwhelmed. He still loves me and he knows we will be happy together, but he chose to give up on us \u2026 on our future together I feel devastated \u2026 hurt \u2026 empty and numb. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore I don\u2019t want anyone else besides him Is the stress causing him to act out n that he\u2019s having an episode? (age 26, from Saudi Arabia)",

I\u2019ve told my therapist about this and I\u2019ve told counselors at my school I even told my mother when I was little, all of them brush it off saying \u201cthat\u2019s just your inner voice.\u201d Or they misinterpret what I mean, most of the time when you hear voices its outside of your head or it comes on later on in life. But mines has always been there since I was little.

I am a student athlete who holds several leadership positions on campus. To everyone I seem great but in reality I\u2019m not even close to being okay. Between all of my commitments I am completely overwhelmed. Nothing is fun anymore and has not been for some time now. Also, I often find myself faced with a deep and powerful hatred toward myself and my mind is often consumed with the notion that I deserve to die. It has progressed to the point that I have been considering suicide as a valid and logical option. Even though cognitively I recognize that it should not even be a consideration. I fight this everyday and I am afraid of what might happen if I lose control for even a little while. That\u2019s why I so strictly maintain the fa\u00e7ade of being completely fine. I fear that if I even allow myself to admit that I am not fine then I would cease to be able to function. The most frustrating part of this whole situation is that there is no reason for it. My life has been great and there is a copious amount of objective evidence that would indicate that I have no reason and no right to feel like this.

My aunt has recently brought my attention to the fact that I show symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder, and I\u2019ve taken many online tests that say I\u2019m extremely likely to have borderline or be somewhere on the schizophrenic spectrum. I get very mad very quickly, and i can\u2019t control my anger. When I was little I would bite the back of my hand hard enough to draw blood out of anger. I choked my baby sister once because I was so angry that she wouldn\u2019t stop crying, and I\u2019ve had to do community service for assault by contact. when I\u2019m walking home from school, I feel like every car that passes is going to kidnap me and murder or hurt me. I can\u2019t sleep with my door shut at night because I\u2019m terrified someone or something is in my room, in my closet or hiding under my bed. I can\u2019t sleep if the door is unlocked, and I have empty soda bottles along my window sill to let me know if someone breaks in. I have to have a nightlight so I can see every corner of my room to be sure no one is there. I also do this thing, where I literally pretend to be someone else entirely.

I don\u2019t feel disconnected from my body when I do it, I just pretend I\u2019m not me. i switch into someone else, but I\u2019m still aware of everything around me. It\u2019s hard to explain. I smoke, I drink occasionally, and I have two tattoos. I\u2019ll also copy the personalities of my best friends, and I\u2019ll do pretty much anything to fit in with my peers. I\u2019m not sure if something is wrong or not, but I decided to ask because my situation at home won\u2019t allow me to go to a doctor. Sorry the question is so long. Thank you.",

When I see people in the street I wonder what it would be like to kill them(mostly out of boredom), and I have thought of ways I would do it \u2013 I\u2019m particularly intrigued by poison or psychologically engineering a suicide because it\u2019s quite passive(not violent/bloody). However, I don\u2019t think I would ever do anything to hurt anyone, to be honest, I think 1) out of laziness and 2) I would want to be 100% sure I would get away with it. I\u2019m an INTJ personality so I am meticulously organized and analytical. I have recently been very withdrawn socially and realized my relationships with people/conversations are quite superficial and I do it just because I sometimes need friends. However, while I feel like I can switch my empathy \u2018off\u2019 (stop caring), I do care very deeply for some people, and I love helping my loved ones and making their lives better. So I don\u2019t understand why I can be a caring person as well as regularly lack empathy / feel superficially charming and manipulative and have fantasies are urges to hurt people?

        "Patient Question": "Through the time he finished high school, my son was considered to be very bright. We have never had to help him with school work, he was often the source of help to his friends in math, science and computers. His teachers loved the way he participated in class. He did well enough to get into a very elite school. At this elite school, expectations are high. Through 2 1/2 years he folds whenever faced with hard work and has had to repeat courses. He was even placed on academic probation for several months. When he went back, he did OK for one quarter and the back to the same problems. Each time, he seems to escape into video games, binge-watching TV serials, etc. We believe there is no reason to suspect substance abuse. He constantly lies about the status of his course work and then gets caught out in stupid ways when he ends up confessing. His friends love him and think highly of him but he avoids building strong relationships. There are probably only 1 or 2 friends he is in touch with regularly. How can we as parents help him see the light? Is there a mental health issue? He says he has seen a counselor but we can\u2019t be sure he is telling the truth.",

It\u2019s a long story, but he had a very rough childhood because of his parents\u2019 choices. She acts like mom-of-the-year, while I am stuck trying to work through my husband\u2019s and my problems without losing my sanity. How can I make her understand that a) she\u2019s not helping, b) her son really DOES have a problem (beyond his depression), and c) that it\u2019s serious, and not something to brush off? When I talk to her about my husband and my arguments, her first instinct is always to ask, \u201cShould I call him?\u201d No, that won\u2019t help. Why would it? Its frustrating that she passive-aggressively blames me for his/our problems. Its frustrating that she thinks she can help him when I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been with my husband for 5 years, going on 6 (married for almost 2). She doesn\u2019t see the real side of him.

Why do I get all of the anger and abuse, when I\u2019m the one trying the hardest to help him and the one with the deepest connection to him? He tells me all the time it\u2019s his mother\u2019s fault for his problems and how she makes things worse, but of course he would never tell her that. So she gets to continue thinking she has nothing to do with his problems because it\u2019s only me who he treats this way. I will also add that we have all been to see a therapist. My husband and I have gone together, but I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s taking the treatments seriously yet, and his mother and brother went once together.

I haven\u2019t been medicated in a while due to the fact I don\u2019t have the funds to meet with a psychiatrist to get the correct prescription. I\u2019ve been doing well without medication and I don\u2019t believe I am experiencing a high or low mood, but I\u2019ve started to notice something else that has become a major concern for me. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been hearing voices that aren\u2019t my own. These voices do not speak to me, they sound more so like someone else talking behind my own thoughts. If I try to focus on the voices when they appear I can\u2019t, they slowly fade away so I can\u2019t really get an idea of what they say. These voices appear during the day and at night while laying down so they arent specific to a tired state. I have never experienced psychosis or hallucinations before and from my knowledge if hallucinations were to appear wouldn\u2019t they be from depression or mania, not a pretty stable mood?

I always stayed in kindergarden and elementary school until 5 or 6 pm, my only friend was my older sister and there the friendship came almost only from my side, because she had friends of her own and I was a bother. In 6th grade people first started talking to me, and I didn\u2019t know what to do or how to react to the things they did, I am still not sure sometimes. I first started paying attention to the people around me. Everyone else was intense to me, I didn\u2019t know what to do when they were in a certain mood. I am not even sure how to handle the emotions of my sister. When someone cried, others came to them, they worried and tried to comfort them. I could look at the crying kid as long as I wanted, I didn\u2019t really feel anything. But it is not like I didnt feel anything. I am pretty sure I feel as much as everyone else, just at the wrong place and wrong time. I don\u2019t talk with my parents about it, I think I bother them. I would like to talk to someone about it, but I wouldn\u2019t know what to say. I just feel out of place. When people actually talk to me, which almost never happens, I don\u2019t know what they actually want from me, even if they perfectly articulate themselves. I never had enough experience with, well, people to know how to comfort someone, to calm someone down, to lead a conversation. I am partly afraid to do the wrong thing, say something wrong, gesturing wrong, act out of place as ever. Also I just have no clue what to do. As I already said, I am pretty sure I have as many emotions as everyone else. I feel numb on a regular basis, but I think everyone has that. But I have a problem with showing emotion, I don\u2019t show what I feel and I have a blank face for almost all the time. I do it subconsciously and only found out because someone asked me about it.

He tells me I\u2019m a worthless person who was sent by him to kill as many as possible. I don\u2019t listen to him of course. But it makes it really difficult for me to trust anyone. Mary is appearing much less than Adonis but she can make everything shake. It feels like the earth is moving, I tend to twitch my body parts (etc: head,palms) and have an extreme anger for no reason at all. They say I got to do what they tell me in order to survive.

I am not sure why it was but perhaps because I maintained good relations with my father despite the divorce. My father was never around since I can remember and I can recall being bullied by harsh words and being mocked at in front of my mother but she would never say anything. Sometimes they would say really nasty things about my dad in front of me and mock me for talking to him, other times they would call me anorexic although I was average fit for my age at the time. I didn\u2019t know even the meaning of anorexia at that time, I must have been 10. Once during my exams, I remember having a huge argument with my mom over how her relatives treat me that way and how she doesn\u2019t stand up for me. I must have been around 14 that time. But my mom always told me to be patient and that family is family. Once I told my Dad and he went in to a fit of rage and threatened my mother that he would take me and since then I got scared to share with my Dad so I only had my sister to really lean on to. But she was a different personality and would always be very silent. It\u2019s been years since then and every year we experienced in our lives not one has gone by where we have not been criticized by them despite our mom having raised us all by herself.

It is troublesome because I have to repeat people all the time, and when I do managers shout at me and I hold back my feelings until I finish my shift which have nightmares about.

I am the oldest in 5 kids and my parents were married for over 15 years. I also come from a middle eastern background and a very strict religious family. So I\u2019m not sure if anyone is going to understand how hard it is to say anything to anyone. So my dad was sick since 2011 he had a stroke that made him paralyzed on his whole left side. I was around 9 years old when he started being sick. My mom would always take care of him and stay by his side or at least that\u2019s what I thought. But when I was 11, I started seeing my mom talk to different guy on the phone and always flirting with him. I was young and I told her mom are you talking to anyone else. But she denied it and then changed the password for her phone so I wouldn\u2019t look at anything. I ignored it for about a year or so, now around this time, my dad was getting better and the relationship between them was great, there weren\u2019t any problems and we almost never saw them fighting, but I still heard her talking to that guy and saw her many times meet with him when my dad wasn\u2019t home and she always thought I didn\u2019t know and I forgot about it. Time passed and I always ignored, I never told anything to any of my other siblings or faced her with it again. Time passed and my dad got sick again, and she was still talking to that guy in addition to 2 other guys that I knew about and they looked a lot younger than her. I would always find a way to know her password and open her chats to see all the flirty messages between her and the other guys. I always cried by myself and kept it in me since then. Speed up to two years ago, I was 14 at that time, my dad got another stroke and was really sick, he passed away. My mom continued to talk to one of the guys and I don\u2019t know what happened to the other two. I regret not telling my dad anything. And if anyone of my uncles knows about her texts and the pictures she sends to that guy, they will kill her because it is against our religion and our culture and they are very strict. I always cry and I still look thru her phone and see all the disgusting things she says and sends to that guy. I don\u2019t know if I should tell anyone or keep it a secret still.

Now, I don\u2019t have any, literally, any desires, needs or wants. I can\u2019t seem to focus on things. My relationship brings me back some tough moments or makes me think how stupid I was. I start getting emotional when I think like that,so I tend to not think about. My friends have been great to support me. I dont understand myself neither my emotions nor my decisions. I have thought couple of times about ending my life but I am very lazy. These days, since I\u2019m very lazy, I procrastinate and waste time a lot, and my mother is very much annoyed by me. Her reactions to my little mistakes make me very angry. Now, anyone who tries to morally correct me, I seem to get a grudge against them. I know its important to let go and move on, but I just cant seem to do anything properly. I have big ambitions but I\u2019m uncertain that I\u2019ll live up to them. My emotions swing drastically. I get annoyed super easily. I thought, I\u2019d need some help, thus, I have come here. (age 15, from India)",

        "Patient Question": " My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years and have one child. We are very openminded and compatible sexually, though our sex life has been through some ups and downs as we have grown as people and experienced child birth and child rearing. The first few years of our relationship, we did some wild things sexually, such as public sex, group sex, voyeurism, etc. We both enjoyed ourselves and were equally involved and responsible for our actions. During and after the pregnancy and birth of our child, however, our sex life went through some drastic changes, and we found ourselves with some sexual issues to work through. One of these issues was my newfound disinterest in our old wild ways; motherhood had turned my viewpoint on it from fun to irresponsible. We have gotten over most of the awkwardness that made its way into our bed, but now we are presented with a somewhat \u201egray area\u2030 issue. Over the past year or so, my husband has been visiting sexual video chat sites and broadcasting himself in various sexual states, most of the time masturbating, in both public and private online communications. At first he did this secretly, until I found out in a very startling way; I investigated the website that kept appearing in our computer\u201as browser history on my phone at work, and was shocked to find a live public video feed of my husband fully aroused. After some obvious conflict over the discovery, we discussed it, and he told me that he missed having our \u201ewild sex life\u2030 and that this helps fulfill that need. He asked if I would participate, and I agreed in hopes of helping to satisfy his sexual mentality. We broadcast ourselves having sex online a few times, having up to 1000 people watch, which completely turned my husband on and completely turned me off. I decided I wasn\u201at going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself. Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him \u201efaithful\u2030 to me since I am no longer interested. (Something you should know about my husband; he is a popular musician and is often confronted with opportunities for sex at shows, but I am confident that he hasn\u201at cheated on me). It is obviously a disturbing experience to get up and find him doing this, and although he is not physically cheating, I still feel hurt and disrespected on these occasions. I basically want an outsider\u201as point of view on whether I should accept this as part of the man I fell in love with and married, reject it on the grounds of how I feel (although I have a hard time with the thought of leaving him over it), or if we should try to work out some sort of compromise. I would like to come up with some way where he can feel fulfilled and I can be a part of it, without making me uncomfortable, but haven\u2019t been able to (not asking you to figure out what that would be for me, just mentioning it). Thank you very much for your time and help with this issue.",

        "Patient Question": "I Do Realize That I Have A Few Psychopathic Traits, However, I\u2019m Not Sure If I Am A Psychopath Or Sociopath. Recently I\u2019ve started to question and compare my actions and thoughts to others. I\u2019ve started to be more aware of myself. I first noticed that whenever I would be angry at someone in close with ( a partner, parent or best friend)my usual feelings that I experience for them disappear completely and it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve changed from the people I care about to the people that I hate the most. So I did research starting from there. I\u2019ve then realized that I lack empathy, guilt, remorse, compassion, you name it. However, I feel empathy for animals, not for humans. This is what\u2019s making me confused. Once I\u2019ve hurt someone, mostly emotionally, I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty, even after my feelings for them have returned (after calming down). I\u2019ve also realized that I\u2019m very manipulative and dominant, I hate it whenever I feel like I\u2019m not in control. I become more aggressive. And once something doesn\u2019t go my way, I play as the victim or I try to make the person feel guilty or pity me so that they can give in. I don\u2019t lie often, mostly because I don\u2019t feel the need to since I don\u2019t do bad things, I don\u2019t mind following the rules as I think that they\u2019re fair and don\u2019t interfere with my life. I do lie sometimes, whenever I need to, I always get away with it. I also have superficial charm, it\u2019s much easier to do online, I\u2019ve noticed that people would fall for me in a matter of days to even a few hours. I don\u2019t think that I am very narcissistic because I do have insecurities but sometimes I would feel like I am better than others, but that kind of feeling disappears quickly. I\u2019ve been told that I can be cruel at times, I do admit that I am, especially towards people I dislike. I also feel satisfaction in seeing them hurt. I have a partner and I do get tremendously jealous, to the point that it\u2019s emotionally violent for my partner. I would like to add that I also get bored very easily. (From Canada)",

One side of me says be patient and I\u2019m too young, the other side of me remembers everyone\u2019s story about their first kiss in middle school, or how a 14 yr old (annoying) friend bragged to me about kissing, while the 17 year old me sits there listening, ignoring his statements and masking jealously. In high school all the kids kissing in the halls, and in lunch and stuff became a tiring image (especially since I was never one of them) and I realized such a strong desire when my failed attempts to be with a crush were for that very reason. I\u2019ve had tons of dreams about making out.

Should I ask my brother to go with me to this training? I wonder if it would be beneficial for him to attend an event like this. I thought maybe through the process of learning how to help other people he can also help himself. My worry is that maybe he would feel pressured or uncomfortable during the training and may breakdown or get more depressed again.",

I have been doing this since I was a child and I am now in my 20s- I would make up scenarios in my head with me in them and I do it all the time. It mostly distracts me from doing my schoolwork and staying present. I find that I also do this during times when I need to listen such as during lectures. When I am home in my room, I will often walk around and around my room while being in the scenario and do this for a long time since childhood. It has now gone to where I will actually whisper or mouth the words I am saying in the scenario. My scenarios tend to be whatever comes to mind and all tend to be pleasant ones. In my real life, it has always been home and school. I have friends but have had friendship problems most of my life, not due to my daydreaming. I like to be social though I am not all that good at it in school. I had a therapist for having high anxiety but never got around to talking about this before I had to stop going.

The problem is it has now been over 3 years and he has not gotten divorced. He avoided his wife for over a year when she tried to start the divorce process and then she got cancer and stopped pursuing him for a divorce. He doesn\u2019t have contact with her but he gets updates on her health from his mother, who still keeps in touch with her. We have lived together for over 2.5 years now and have gone many places and always take photos wherever we go. His public-facing social media profiles are pictures from when he was with his wife. And he has changed the pictures since he moved in with me, but still changed them to old pictures from his life with her. He has one small item of hers that holds a lot of sentimental value that she has asked him to return to her by mail and he told her he would but still hasn\u2019t done so.

Most of the time, she tells me to be careful, don\u2019t come back late at night, don\u2019t go into other people\u2019s houses, don\u2019t believe what everyone is saying. It makes me feel useless and stupid, like I can\u2019t take care of myself. It also makes me second guess all my emotional attachments. As it is, I have never been in a relationship, because I never trust the men that try to ask me out. I am not particularly anxious about not being in a relationship but I do wonder whether or not I just don\u2019t need a partner right now, or it is a self-imposed independence search. I understand the fact that my mother, like all mothers, is worried. She is also an anxious individual in her day to day life. However, she makes me anxious as well, up to the point where I fear getting hurt or running into problems, not because I\u2019m trying to take care of myself, but because I\u2019m afraid she will say \u201cI told you so\u201d. How can I make myself take her comments more lightly, but maintain my good relationship with her. With my father having died a year ago, I feel like we both need each other more than ever. I just wish she understood she is just worsening my already conflicted mental state and that at 22, it is far too late for her to try to dictate my social life. She warns me about the world being a dangerous place, then makes fun of my hermit status and lack of extended social circle. (From Romania)",

I couldn\u2019t help him then and I can\u2019t help him now.

Last week I watched a documentary in sociology on the Jonestown massacre where 900 people died all those people just threw their lives away because one man told them to.

He showed up unannounced for years often at supper hour and whenever he liked. After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened. We repeatedly asked him to call before he came, but he would show up anyway and say \u201cIf you are busy I just go.\u201d\u00a0If we say we are busy he argues. Visits are often and prolonged. Finally, after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request. His first response was \u201cYou don\u2019t like me.\u201d I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children. He didn\u2019t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again. Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again. This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now. My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood. After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit. His response is usually the same. \u201cI may come, not sure what I am doing yet.\u201d That ends up tying up our night as we don\u2019t know if he is coming or not. If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up. Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company. It is badly straining our marriage as I can\u2019t even rely on having a peaceful night. Hubby is stressed because he doesn\u2019t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn\u2019t complain. He also is extremely rude to us and other guests. He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him. Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message. The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues. A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read \u201cControlling People\u201d and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative. How can I help my husband not feel guilty about insisting his uncle respect boundaries? My husband tries, then his uncles manipulates him and my husband yells at me as to why he can\u2019t come over when he wants. (From Canada)",

At the age of about 8 years, a psychiatrist suggested that he had Asperger\u2019s. At the time, I didn\u2019t think this was a correct diagnosis. However, after years of crisis after crisis, I am beginning to think otherwise. Since finishing high school, he has moved in and out of our home several times. At one point he was a heavy user of marijuana and perhaps some other drugs and became psychotic. He has problems getting along with others when working, has gone from job to job (mostly in the service industry), and I think it\u2019s because of his Asperger\u2019s. He is not good with money. When he moves back home with us, he is irritable and angry and takes things the wrong way. He is not totally aware of the feelings of other family members. He just broke the lease for his apartment because he was having problems with the people living above him making noise. He is going to college and he was unable to do his studies. Because of this he has temporarily moved back home once again. He is very knowledgeable about computers and hopes to one day start his own business. He refuses to go for any professional help and thinks the problems are the fault of others. We are at a loss as to what to do to help him. Any suggestions? Thank you. (age 63, from Canada)",

Growing up I didn\u2019t have very many friends, and the ones I did have emotionally abused me in the relationship from 3rd grade all the way up to 6th grade. My father was very emotionally neglectful and never gave me his approval. When I was 9 years old I had my first dream of killing someone, but I don\u2019t remember the dream as a negative, I remember being more fascinated. Theses dream accrued now and again through the passing years. I have been also diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety. I only really have one or two friends at a time because I have a very hard time trusting new people and are very suspicious of them at the beginning of a relationship. And somebody can only screw me over If I let them, by either trusting them or letting down my guard. Pity the fool who decides to earn my trust and screw me, they will know what it feels like to hurt. If I don\u2019t destroy them in that instant, I will keep my enemy close until I have everything I need to bring him all the way down to nothing. And ever since I was young I have been able to make anybody feel any emotion I want them to feel. I can go from happy to cry just by choice if I choose to do so. I feel disconnected with my emotions and they are more something I use to fit in. Around 6th grade, I learned that retaining appearance was very important to my future with relationships. So I started paying attention to other people\u2019s emotions and listening to others to understand and see what pain, regret, shame, confidence, etc look like.

I started wondering if I was being abused about a year ago, and recently read an article on this website that seemed to detail exactly how I feel and how I was treated. The title of this article is \u2018Emotional Abuse and the Impact of Absence.\u2019 He would withdraw without telling me what was wrong, leaving me to guess. He would rarely apologize, and seemed to be emotionally unavailable. Sometimes his withdrawal was due to me being upset about something that had nothing to do with him. He was extremely critical of my children, and my family. He found fault in the way my kids walked too loud, held their fork wrong, a look on their face he didn\u2019t like, etc. and claimed that it wasn\u2019t their behavior that was the problem, but my lack of disciplining them for it. However, it seemed no matter how I responded, he would find fault with it, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells when he was around because I never knew what would irritate him next.\u00a0 In the past, I have tried to tell him how his actions made me feel, and how it affected me, but he responded with defensiveness and I ended up feeling worse, like everything was my fault.\u00a0I felt like I was accepting any crumb of affection or attention from him even though I knew I wasn\u2019t being treated right. I quit trying to talk to him about my hurt feelings because I feared it would just make him withdraw more, and possibly end the relationship. I\u2019ve told him the situation was emotionally unhealthy for me, but I never confronted him about his actions being emotionally abusive. Now that the relationship has ended, I\u2019m still struggling with all the hurtful things he did, and can\u2019t seem to get past it. Should I confront him and tell him I think he was emotionally abusive and why? I\u2019m afraid if I do, he\u2019ll respond negatively and I\u2019ll end up feeling worse, and if I don\u2019t, it will continue to eat away at me, and I\u2019ll regret not standing up for myself.

First she was diagnosis as Major Depression with psychosis, then schizophrenia, then they were ruling out PTSD and now they are saying Psychosis since the PTSD symptoms were from delusions.She is taking Geodon, Zoloft, Trihexyphenidyl and Temazepan\u2026which are helping.

I met a guy 2 and a half years ago he was married when I met him but separated his wife had gone back to Germany where she was from and he and I really fell for each other we dated for 2 years and then I decided that we should take a break because he had done 2 tours in Iraq and I felt he needed to deal with some of the stuff he went through over there before we could move forward I told him that I loved him very much and that I would wait for him. We kept in touch, and always talked about getting back together. One day I was searching on the internet and I found his wife\u2019s Myspace page from the looks of it she wasn\u2019t in Germany and never had been it talked about living here with her wonderful husband and that they were planning on having another baby this year. I did more digging and found a mound of evidence that she was here the whole time and not only that I believe there were other woman he was with as well. I\u2019m so devastated how could I be so stupid for over two years? I was and am despite everything still so in love with him we are no longer talking but how do you make love just go away it may have been a lie to him but it was real to me. I almost don\u2019t want to be alive anymore I just can\u2019t get over the lies and deceit. Honesty is so important to me and he knew that. How do I move past this and stop obsessing?

        "Patient Question": "A few months ago, I started seeing a counselor for the first time at my college. The reality is, I should have seen a counselor a very long time ago but I was always reluctant too until a recent breakdown. My entire life, I\u2019ve always felt very anxious around almost any social situation. I have always been extremely shy and struggle making friends. I assume people are thinking negative of me and won\u2019t like me, therefore I may come off really distant and very difficult to get to know. I struggle trusting anyone, making it really hard for me to make friendships (or keep friendships of any kind). It causes me a lot of issues in my job and my professional performance because I lack self-confidence and fear being judged. The counselor seemed to agree that what I was explaining seemed a lot like social anxiety. Even going to see a counselor was extremely challenging even after multiple sessions, I was still feeling as anxious/shy since the first few sessions. It\u2019s really hard for me to warm up to people (if not seemingly impossible even if I know them for years) even though the counselor was very kind and nice. I found therapy hard and became frustrated with myself, so I called it quits after like the 8th or 9th session. I did make some progress and learned a lot, so it wasn\u2019t a total waste of time. But overall, I felt hopeless like things for me weren\u2019t ever going to change. I\u2019m able to \u201cChallenge\u201d my negative thoughts with more positive ones but it didn\u2019t really change how I truly felt. So, I began doing some research online about SAD and came across the term \u201cavoidant personality disorder\u201d\u2026the description seemed very similar to SAD and began to wonder what if I had APD? Then, I also learned that treating personality disorders can be very difficult and may not be curable but treatment may relieve some symptoms. It kind of made me feel hopeless because what if the reason I haven\u2019t been able to be \u201cfree\u201d from this is because I have APD? Or am I overreacting? I\u2019m not a huge fan of labels but wondering if it\u2019s common for a therapist to tell you if they diagnosed you or not? Mine didn\u2019t really ever \u201cdiagnose\u201d me, they did however tell me the therapy we did was CBT.",

        "Patient Question": "I was accused of murdering my cousin when she came to live with me and my mother, and stepfather. I was unwell and under care of a psychiatrist at the time which solely led to police unwilling to move their focus to anyone else. It was public, and things came out that I felt were unfair, both true and false. I\u2019ve been obsessed with having my side of the story known. My life since then has been aimless and but for that goal. I now realize I lost 15 years trying and hoping for something that I had no evidence would make any difference anyway. That too, something of an epiphany further adding to my current state. That is one where I now feel no purpose or have any desire to do anything with life and feel it not too far away where it becomes unmanageable and I will commit suicide, albeit not wanting it. Can it be as simple as writing to a newspaper and saying \u201cup yours if you think I am the killer, and all these other things you have read about me\u201d? To the police who botched the whole investigation from day one, never to even give us a crime scene, \u201d I think you need to provide answers to my family, and show why I should still be a suspect when there is no evidence, not just against me, but not against anyone or anything. Nothing. There is zero but for my having mental health treatment from a doctor which I sought. I went for help. And ended up before the courts and newspapers because of it. I\u2019ve never been able to get past not speaking out in my defense, and I guess also that no family did for me either. It was horrible and now its all for nothing over a decade later. How can I get a sense of drive, purpose in life. I care not for work or career of any kind now. I don\u2019t fear consequences for myself.",

        "Patient Question": "I have recently been thinking and realized that I exhibit most sociopathic traits. I\u2019m a liar, I steal money occasionally, and I lack guilt. I can\u2019t feel remorse or guilt for anything I do. I never feel REAL attachments. I may have developed these traits due to my rough childhood. My father was absent for the past 8 years. He used to call and ask for money, in which my mother made me pick up and relay her messages. I felt like a helpless puppet, and I was angry that they didn\u2019t care how I felt. My father was manipulative and was in general an evil person. I\u2019m not like him completely. As I said, I can\u2019t feel bad for others. I\u2019ve watched VERY graphic, violent videos and feel nothing. I even laugh at the way the victims die. I get annoyed by people who bother me. I feel like shoving a pen into their idiotic eyeballs. I am impulsive and cannot think ahead. I rarely experience fear, and never distress (except pain). I (willingly) think of horrible things happening to people I love, and I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m only nice to people for what they can offer me. I see my brother and his girlfriend express affection for each other, and I can\u2019t understand love. I used to be a really nice, caring, understanding kid. Now I\u2019m impatient and & rude. I keep up the sociopathic mask so I don\u2019t seem insane. I have dead eyes, and often make people uncomfortable with my stare. I recently took interest in a girl, and I liked her. After enough time, I broke her and her boyfriend up. I manipulated her, while maintaining a friendly smile . It almost worked, but things went South and they got back together. This heartbreak made me block out emotions (sound familiar). I\u2019m not seeking help, because tbh I like my mindset. But I just want to know once and for all if I\u2019m a sociopath. Thanks for reading!",

I am currently in therapy, and have been for over a year. I completely trust my therapist, but am so embarrassed and scared of this situation that I don\u2019t know how to approach it. The attraction is somewhat sexual in nature, but I think it may be related to past trauma. I have sort of created three of this counselor in my mind; the one that\u2019s just normal, the one I have sexual feelings for, and the one I just want to be emotionally and physically close with. I have had similar feelings toward other people that I am not supposed to feel that about, but never anything on this level. Does this sound like a somewhat typical response to trauma? How do I go about addressing it, so that I don\u2019t feel this way anymore?",

My dad always thought i did in middle school because i dont put my lips to my fork when i eat i use my teeth to \u201crake\u201d the food off instead and i always thought that was crazy. At the time i was about five foot six and weighed about 130 wich i thought was a bit much until i saw myself in a full length mirror. now im a senior in highschool and im five foot seven and as of this morning im 144.3 lbs. I worked my way up to 167 last year and tried to get down to 140 for prom. I diddnt succeed and i ended up eating so much i gained 10 of the 20 lbs i lost and then over summer after i got diagnose with celiacs disease i diddnt eat very much, there would be days i just skipped food all together. everyday at the pool more and more guys would look and I felt more confident. when i went to my doctor for my celiacs doctor about a month ago, she said that my weight concerned her. apparently 140 is the lowest my body can be without being unhelthy and i weighed in at 142. I still didnt feel it was enough and about 2 weeks ago i discovered that if i take my adhd medicine everyother day not only can i slack off when i really want to but i get sick and then im not hungry. I went down to 140.2 for about 4 days and i felt like a fat kid. In gym I couldnt run as fast as normal and i was out of breath in no time, when we got back i looked in the mirror and saw how gross i looked. my boyfriend thinks im self destructive in ways other that not eating because he sees me eating apples and rice bars alot and thinks its the only healthy thing i do for my body since i stopped cutting.But he dosnt understand either way and dosnt seem to notice either way so i figure hes happy about thedirection of my figure. I couldnt get my meds to make me sick anymore last week so i stopped taking them and i just ate everything with sugar or chocolate or fat and went up to 147 and it freaked me out. Christmas eve i took my meds without thinking and like usual when i take hem i diddnt eat. a few hours later i got really sick but due to a childhood surgery im unable to vomit so i just dryheave and it hurts but im used to it. I diddnt eat untill christmas morning(yesterday) and i ate all day long. then thismorning i did my usual. I got in my yogapants and a bra and ran down to weigh myself. unhappy with being almost 5 lbs above goal i got off and looked in the mirror again. poking and pulling and shaking i decided that i need to get back down but mom handed me a bowl of oatmeal that im currently avoiding and thinking about flushing even tho im starving so i think ill take my meds again tomorrow so ill be at my goal before mybirthday on the 29th and then ill beable to decide if i need to loose more or not. i realise this cant benormal. making myself sick to avoid food instead of making myself purge it and actually eating so is it really an eating dissorder if i take vitamins to get my minerals and then skip a day here and there for food but i never actually purge it?if so how do i fix myself, im too scared to tell my councellor because she thinks ive made so much progress wih everything else i dont want to dissapoint her and shed probably want me to tell mom who would make me eat at the table again so she knows im eating\u2026 I want to be in the fashion and art world and food just makes me fat\u2026 not fashionable nor artistic but disgusting and lathargic and even with crunches and dieting i cant seem to look the way i want \u2026 i also feel that im unhelthy weight already because the chart for weight is based off hight and im prety sur my chest is probably about 15 or 20 lbs of my weight wich means id be at unhelthy weight already wouldnt it?

And my body feels \u201cfake\u201d to me, as if it\u2019s not truly my own body. I hardly even can recognize myself in the mirror and will sometimes avoid mirrors for this reason. I will have moments where I\u2019m dragged out of my surreal state. Some are random, some have a cause. The times that are random if feels as if I have been flying my whole life and for but a moment I touch my feet to the earth and feel trapped. The light seems new, the people I thought I new seem like strangers. I have kind of \u201chypersensitivity\u201d to the world and all motions feel strange. The things I had just been doing feel like a distant memory. This happens randomly. Sometimes I can be forcefully dragged out of my surreal state, usually by comments about my body or actions. I feel like a stranger to myself with a sudden awareness that people only see my body and my actions but they don\u2019t truly see me, they never can see who I really am.

I always put the concerns to rest, but I am realizing now that I cannot ignore it anymore. As I am getting older I see that my behavior and feelings about intimacy and sex do not make sense to me. I feel very confused. I always feel threatened by men and constantly feel the need to have a guard up. I was always afraid of men when I was little, but at the same time there was this curiosity and I was known to be very flirtatious. It is hard to talk about but I have 2 polar feelings about sex and I always feel like an object rather than a person. The reason I suspect I may have been sexually abused as a child is because my memory keeps bringing me back to this journal that I had. I believe it was my first journal. I remember vividly what it looked like. I remember being extremely sad at the time when I would write in my journal. Throughout my life until I left to college I used journals as a way to express my feelings. I grew up in a home where my father was verbally/emotionally/ and somewhat physically abusive and I was not allowed to have a voice so I would put all my feelings and thoughts in my journals. The reason I bring up this journal is because my memory keeps going back to this page in the journal. It honestly disturbs me. I was a young child it could have been a joke but the drawing I drew in the journal was of a naked man. I was around 6 or 7 years old when I drew this. I drew the penis correctly. however I keep wondering how did I know what a penis looked like at that age? In addition the the drawing, I drew a line coming from tip of penis down to bottom of page and then the line became intense scribbles going in a circle looking like a puddle. I do not understand why my mind keeps taking me there. I want to find that journal but I cannot remember where it is. It just disappeared.",

About a year ago his friend stayed over at our house while we were out on vacation, I\u2019ve never met his friend before and only said yes because he said his friend was trustworthy. His friend ended up bringing over a female coworker and not letting us know but I found an eyeliner so I was upset and asked my boyfriend to talk to him since he didn\u2019t want me to talk to his friend myself. Fast forward to last night his friend (the same one) called me my boyfriends ex-girlfriends name. Keep in mind this guy has been at my house and my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I got upset and ended up leaving early because I was so mad and didn\u2019t want to make a scene with someone I barely knew. Before I left I told my boyfriend he needed to talk to him because his friend disrespected me and made me wonder why he would call me someone\u2019s name who was in my boyfriend\u2019s life over 4 years ago. He said he talked to him and told him to apologize to me so his friend tried to add me on Instagram to apologize. I want nothing to do with his friend and I\u2019m upset that all my boyfriend did was have a talk with his friend that I made him have and then went on to act like nothing happened. Now we\u2019re arguing because I\u2019m afraid my boyfriend doesn\u2019t respect me since he did absolutely nothing except what I asked him to do. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to deal with after being with him for 4 years, we also just bought a house together 3 months ago. Am I wrong to want him to do more than just talk to his friend (a talk I asked him to do) ? He thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable and doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal since his friend made a mistake.",

He is perfect in all ways but sexual, I know he loves me. He proves it every day in countless ways.For many years now, I have totally buried my sexuality. I have, in fact, denied myself and not let myself be who I am. I have felt bad for being so sexual. I would try to initiate and/or discuss sex but has left him feeling pressured, demeaned and somehow the need to feel that he needed to be changed. Now, he is stuck in his own self-awareness of all that he feels he is not. To other women he was something. To me\u2026 I thought he was something else, that\u2019s all. As a result, we\u2019ve been terribly unhappy. I feel I have been in the hellish grip of a major depression. This life we have created is untenable for both of us. He cannot give me the sex I want.

I feel like I am mourning the little girl he helped me find again and now is gone, hidden, struck with the memories of why she went away to begin with. I feel that I have to worthy to leave.

He had alot of anger issues and was slightly emotionally abusive. One time I let him discipline my then 7 yr old boy, but he got too rough and threw him across his bed. I did not condone this and I swore to my son that he would never have to be around that man again. We had some miscommunication a couple nights later that I used to my advantage and pushed his buttons enough to make him spiral out of control and he came and broke into my house while the kids I were sleeping. No one was hurt and the kids never woke up. I broke up with him the next day after the cops escorted him home. Now to present day another 10 months later we are talking again. He has received enough counseling to help himself and I see him as different and changed for the better. I also am ready for a more committed relationship so we have been seeing each other for about 2 months now. I am so happy and we\u2019ve apologized and he has validated my feelings about what happened that night and in general so that we can try and move on and Im making more of an effort towards a relationship this time, but my son is terrified of him. The bf and I are taking it much slower this time and not involving the kids at all for at least 6 months but will it be possible to reintroduce them and patch things up or am I being selfish for even trying? I gave them my word that he would never be in our lives again because I never in a million years thought it would be possible for him to have changed. I am at a crossroads.

        "Patient Question": "Hi, this has been bothering me for quite some time. I am looking to get some clarity about some major psychological symptoms I suffered from in the past which actually became alleviated on there own. Now in hindsight I\u2019m wondering what happened. I am a 36yr old female. When I was between the ages of 11-19 my home life was incredibly tumultuous and stressful. Not surprisingly, I suffered from insomnia and from 16-19 began taking a fair amount of Melatonin to try and get my sleep cycle back in order \u2013 which didn\u2019t work. All of my symptoms only came on at night \u2013 not when I was sleeping but the house was quiet and everyone else in bed. I would have auditory hallucinations of people talking in the attic above me or outside my window. Always just low enough so I couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying but loud enough that I was absolutely positive someone was there. I was also incredibly paranoid about people breaking into my house (and thinking I would hear people breaking in) which would lead me to be up and down all night checking out sounds and checking doors to make sure they were locked. This went on almost every night for months at a time over several years. Eventually, I moved out, began to create healthy limits with my family and the symptoms subsided. Aside from a few episodes of sleep-walking, everything was pretty normal until I was about 27-29. I moved into a house with my not-yet husband and was unhappy at my job but the stress was nowhere near the level of my previous home life. Again, the symptoms resurfaced. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. I was stay awake or sit up in bed for hours because I kept thinking I heard people breaking into the house. I was hearing noises and get up again and again all night checking things out, only to have no signs of anything amiss. Eventually, the symptoms subsided, I quit my job and haven\u2019t had these symptoms since. Yes, I do have a history of mental illness in the family \u2013 Bi-polor disorder, schizo-affective disorder and major anxiety disorders. Can someone explain what may have been happening to me?

        "Patient Question": "A couple years ago I spoke to my doctor about the emotional state that I expressed was over because I didn\u2019t want to admit it was current, and he said that most likely I had experienced depression. At the time I honestly believed it would go away however it has only gotten much worse over the past three years. Last year was a hard year for my entire family including death, divorce, and my sister\u2019s diagnosis with a psychosis. Even before her time in the mental hospital, my parent\u2019s drinking had gotten far out of hand and my mom was gambling more than ever. Recently they have tried to fix things, but meanwhile I\u2019m feeling worse and have more and more nearly swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills experiences every week, and I pretty much don\u2019t even have a relationship with my parents anymore. My drinking is getting more and more frequent as well, and I just keep floating farther and farther away from who i used to be, I\u2019m pretty much floating above this robot barely going through every day. However, I don\u2019t trust or am able to rely on either of my parents to handle any of this, as they are very unstable. But I need help, and I\u2019m only fourteen. I can\u2019t rely on the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline anymore, nor can vodka help me anymore than it already does. How can I get help without destroying my parent\u2019s lives?

        "Patient Question": "\u2026 personally Identifiable Medical & Detailed Financial Info Being Legally Exploited/Sold Via EHR & FICO MAS: Will mental health care providers ever focus on those who have actual mental health issues? The only thing that anyone now seems to care about is addiction medicine. That is crap, drug(opioid/heroin) addicts made a choice at some point, they chose to abuse opioids and that is a crime. Crikey the dangers of opioids were the focus of a long running TV series (House), and post successful long running \u201cDARE\u201d educational programs, the opioid epidemic is an excuse by pharma/politicians to generate billions of PROFIT. And cartel gangs like MS-13 just exacerbated the situation/access as did the opioid bill. Hospital inpatient wards, like Sentara are all about increasing revenue/profit as well, to cut expensive nursing staff, they now have one co-ed locked ward that combines abused/trauma/MDD patients with criminals detoxing before they go to jail. There is no actual individual or group therapy, there are techs who act just as babysitters. The MDs forget to write prescriptions, and are masters of the $400 handshake. Criminals/addicts stay free get top quality concierge care, eating disorders, MDD, PTSD get screwed via $10,000 2 night stay/hold for NO CARE just when they needed a thorough health/psych eval to determine if/what other pharma based treatments might be more effective \u2013and the therapist at the medical school said the only way was via inpatient. These are worse health care conditions than those that existed 30-50 years ago. Bottom line, addicts and autism are it. No one gives a fig about anyone else. Do you think this will ever change? If not, the suicide rate will skyrocket in the next 1-3 years. Heck, it is easy to get end of life drugs but impossible to use lethal injection for criminals on death row because no one wants to make new drugs for use in criminal lethal injections, but helping the terminally ill and elderly wanting to die by a different set of lethal drugs is cause for social celebration. So how does one tell a psychiatrist they like/worked with for a few years that in all probability, at some point a year or two down the road, there is a an increasing risk that society & low quality (value based) cheap toxic, high side effect laden generic meds and lower quality of overall drive through heath care will trigger/drive them to suicide? Especially now that every call to a GP seems to result in the receptionist asking for a social security number, and upon opening your EHR containing mental health hospitalization, dets well, immediately their tone changes to a rude condescending judgmental \u201cyou are wasting my time\u201d because you spent time (MDD/PTSD) in the psych ward, the next available apt is 5 months from now.",

It started when I (age 26) went on a trip to Europe with my brother and I got a terrible flu, and on our tour bus I began having a psychosis. I thought I could hear the whole bus talking about me being stupid and ugly. Even outside where we couldn\u2019t find people from our tour bus, I heard them talking about me, it freaked me out so much I had to ask my brother if he could hear it too , which he said no. I did have a high fever so that could have explained what was happening, but even after that occurrence there are times, not every day, I go out and I feel like I can hear people calling me ugly and stupid, or if they are laughing I think they are laughing at me. I moved to the city and I rarely want to go out because I\u2019m afraid I will have an episode again. My boyfriend knows when I have these episodes because I become quiet and disoriented. That is because I try to listen to peoples conversations and find out if I\u2019m going crazy or they are talking about me. Also, I do not hear voices when I am alone but only when there are people around talking so I do not know if it is because I keep mishearing or interpreting the wrong way. I am worried and not sure if I need to seek help from a therapist. Thank you for your help. I would like to add that I do not take any medications or drugs.",

There have been a number of stressful events for him lately: I had a minor health crisis and a car accident (unrelated), he experienced medication-induced weight gain (a BIG no-no for him). Also, he was adopted as a baby and recently found his biological family. That\u2019s been very positive, but very emotional too. Lately, he\u2019s been lashing out at me on a regular \u2014 almost nightly basis. The slightest thing can set him off. He gets angry if I don\u2019t help enough. But many times, I\u2019ll ask \u201cWhat can I do for you after work?\u201d He\u2019ll say \u201cnothing.\u201d Then he gets mad at me for not helping. Or he\u2019ll say he had ABCDXYZ to do and I didn\u2019t do any of it. If I point out that I had no idea he had all that and he should have asked for my help, he snaps that I should have just known it. I try to stay calm but it\u2019s hard not to feel hurt when he hurls accusations at me, like saying I don\u2019t care about him and that I just married him for his money. That\u2019s not true. He\u2019s also angry that I\u2019m close to my family (he\u2019s never gotten along with his adoptive parents) and he keeps insisting that I must have been molested as a child and then brainwashed because that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019d be so loyal to them. I\u2019m hoping finding and bonding with his biological family \u2014 which is already happening \u2014 will help with the family stuff but I\u2019m still afraid. I love my family. I know they\u2019re not perfect but I also know they\u2019d NEVER hurt me. Or him.

She has been on Risperidone for about 4 years now and has usually been okay. But in the last year she\u2019s had two episodes, not full-blown but bad enough to cause us all stress (her family). I have two questions today: Does this mean the medication is no longer working?

A language she never speaks nor does she speak it correctly, it\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s making up words.

Along side going to CAMHS, I\u2019ve done some research of my own. My therapist keeps saying that it\u2019s anxiety that i have, when what ive seen relates, but seems more than that. I have been hearing voices which are almost indecipherable, and as time passes theyre getting easier and easier to understand. I\u2019ve looked through several sites and compared and came up with some things based on the things mentioned repeatedly throughout the sites. What ive come up with is that it could be some type of schizoaffective disorder, or schizophrenia. In general I feel depersonalized most of the time, and over the years ive learned to just get on with it, and found ways to deal with it, but it seems to be getting worse. The treatment that my therapist is giving me is CBT, and to be honest, it helps a bit, but not nearly enough :/ Do you think this is anxiety, or am I completely wrong to think of schizoaffective disorder/schizophrenia?",

This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he\u2019s coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving. In which doesn\u2019t make any sense because he said he didn\u2019t want to go anywhere. I have told him how much these things bother me. Every time, he turns around and says what bother him. Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it\u2019s difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn\u2019t like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn\u2019t critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn\u2019t say anymore. For example, he used to call me \u201cpretty girl\u201d. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship. I wasn\u2019t very mature when we started dating so I made some poor decisions that I would never do presently. I\u2019d love to know what changed our relationship so much? Is he acting like this for revenge or because he\u2019s not happy? I can honestly say I\u2019m miserable when I\u2019m around him.

I was put on modafinil and it helped a little bit but eventually wore off and now I\u2019m on armodafinil which has even less of an effect than modafinil did. The doc also prescribed Lexapro (which i\u2019ve been on before) with the armodafinil and this time around it made me feel kind of depressed. The doctor took me off of it (this is a sleep doctor by the way) and explained that since I had a bad reaction to the Lexapro that i may have Bi-polar Depression. I don\u2019t fit the signs of this but upon trying to relate to this condition I stumbled upon ADHD symptoms, how it is confused with depression, and how it can go undetected. The symptoms of ADHD fit me like a glove. I am forgetful, I lose things to an extreme that it disrupts my life. I have had anxiety since I was a child, I\u2019m restless, impulsive, impatient, I have very bad fidgeting and nail-biting habits, I zone out on conversations, I have had drug and alcohol addictions in the past, I drink coffee all day and all night long, and my husband is put through hell trying to keep up with and clean up my messes, I even have to keep my cards and ID in his wallet so that I don\u2019t lose them.

From childhood, I lacked self control for example I was eating continuously, watching T.V. continuously for 8 to 10 hours, neglecting my health. I was messed up and never told anyone about this. Right now I have cut off all my contact with my brother and my condition is getting worse after I realized and accepted I was sexually abused. My daily activities has been severely hampered and I can\u2019t seem to take control of my life, I feel like I am possessed and control by someone else when I am staying alone.

My boyfriend is a very caring and sensitive guy and we both love each other very much, but I\u2019m concerned that some of my pre-existing sexual issues may cause problems down the road for our relationship. I have primary vaginismus and vulvodynia, and my first sexual experiences were very negative and traumatic. I have been to a gynecologist about these issues and went through physical therapy to try and overcome them, but even after a few years penetration is still painful and sometimes very difficult. While trusting my partner makes a big difference in reducing the amount of pain I\u2019m in during sex, and with my current boyfriend there have been several occasions where it was virtually painless, it\u2019s still a constant factor in my sex-life. While I do enjoy the intimacy of sex with my boyfriend despite this, I have never been able to achieve orgasm no matter what my partner tries to do or for how long. Even with assistance from vibrators it\u2019s virtually impossible, and the only way I\u2019ve managed to achieve orgasm is by my own intervention. I don\u2019t understand why I have this issue, especially because I am very attracted to him. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t complain to me about it or anything like that, but I can tell that it makes him feel self-conscious. I\u2019ve tried explaining to him that it\u2019s not his fault at all, but I worry that he still feels like he\u2019s inadequate. What should I do?",

Yet first chance he gets he\u2019s online looking at half naked/naked woman. Is our relationship in trouble? Talking just angers him and makes me feel more like he doesn\u2019t care how it makes me feel. I\u2019m not naive enough to think he\u2019d stop looking at other chicks online, I just want him to look at me too. It\u2019s gotten to where I hardly sleep in the same room with him because I hate the way I feel. Our sex life is horrible. He\u2019s always been a slightly selfish lover but now it\u2019s pretty much always a completely selfish lover except for maybe 1 time out of 6 in a 3 moth period, and I stress the maybe. I love him and even though he\u2019s selfish and stingy like an only child can seem to be, I know he loves me as well, other than this issue we get along rather well. We have not ever fought or argued over anything other than this. Honestly every time I try to say something about how it makes me feel, or ask if he could please act like I am someone pretty in his eyes, he clams up,and if I push it or ask how to fix it or what I\u2019m doing wrong, he eventually blows up on me. Never saying he\u2019s sorry for hurting me or making me feel like he is not attracted to me, he says I am in the wrong, he\u2019s a man, what else did I expect, and things of that nature.I don\u2019t know what to do, but I know things cannot continue on this way much longer. My heart hurts, I cry way too much for my taste, and I am losing confidence in me. I\u2019m 37, 5\u20193 ,and 123 lbs, I know I\u2019m pretty, but at the same time I don\u2019t FEEL pretty anymore.

        "Patient Question": "From England: Okay so ever since I was very young I\u2019ve had a problem with zoning out. When I was about 4 my parents became very worried, I zoned out in the middle of conversations and I could be walking from one room to another and end up walking into a door or wall because of it. I have two older siblings and neither of them ever did this so my mum was ready to bring me to the doctors but my dad thought it was just my age as well as an over active imagination. My older sister has aspergers syndrome so my mum feared the worst but when I was older (around 6-7) I got checked for this and like my other older sister, I was fine. I still did well in school, it never really affected that but I did zone out in class occasionally. It never went away but was less frequent after around 10 years old however now I am 15 and for at least 6 months now it seems to have been becoming more and more frequent. I\u2019m zoning out more and more and when I finally snap back into reality I\u2019m not even sure how much time has passed, its kind of like being in a trance. Its not like it only happens when I\u2019m bored, I can be doing something I really enjoy and then I just zone out. I\u2019m also developing a strange liking for a little bubble I\u2019m starting to create, which is totally separate from the zoning out as I actually feel conscious during it. I just go into a kind of \u2018bubble\u2019 and begin imagining different things, I find this really comforting but I\u2019m concerned about how much I\u2019m enjoying it, I could do it for hours on end and it feels so much better then real life. I\u2019m more concerned about the zoning out more though as I\u2019m not actively imagining or thinking during it, I\u2019m just kind of not there and I cant stop it happening, it just happens whenever. I definitely don\u2019t think I have ADD or anything, I would just like to know whether I should be concerned about this behaviour or not.",

Anything can trigger it but I seem to have narrowed it down to three general triggers. All of these triggers are things that I normally would never give a second thought let alone burst into tears about. 1) Any large group activity \u2013 baseball games, choir performances, kids school performances. If a group is together and I\u2019m part of it, at some point I cry. 2) When anyone shares anything the least bit sentimental. For example \u2013 a friend of mine was talking about her son\u2019s kindergarten graduation. His teacher taught the kids the sign language sign for \u201cI love you\u201d so that the next year that would be their secret signal around the school. Cute right? Cute. She was telling me this and I burst into tears! To the point I couldn\u2019t speak. This happens all the time. 3) Anytime I have to speak about anything spiritual. I\u2019ve almost stopped going to church. I can\u2019t talk about any of it \u2013 not even planning a simple kids activity without crying at some point.",

I kind of really want to see a psychiatrist and try some medication but my parents are really against that, but they don\u2019t see how desperate I am- Im way to scared to tell them I have suicidal thoughts a lot because I know they do so much for me, I just feel really desperate and want to try out medication so I\u2019m just wondering if you can offer some advice on what approach I should take to this situation.

We went out on a boat trip with my family the next day. My boyfriend got really drunk and got into a fight with me because he wanted me to drive him to his friends (we were in the middle of the ocean). I tried hugging him to show I loved him and it was okay and to calm down but that just made it worse. He said I tried to smother him, broke up with me in front of my family, and forced my family to take him to a private beach where he waited for someone to pick him up. Once we both got back home a few days later we tried to talk but he told me that I never supported his mental health. I had no idea he felt this way, that episodes like this were so intense. He told me he had bipolar but he never talked about it.

I was the only one to whom he kept talking. He began to spend most of the day in his bedroom. He also began to use monosyllable words to reply to my parents, aunts, cousins\u2026 Never started a conversation unless you addressed him. Now, at 19 (almost 20), it has evolved to the point he doesn\u2019t talk to anybody, not even to me, and not even with monosyllables. He doesn\u2019t look anybody in the face either (he didn\u2019t do that a few years ago). If I try to talk to him, he ignores me or makes a sound of annoyance and kicks me out of his bedroom. He is very childish too, in the sense that it is part of his routine to watch cartoons with his favorite stuffed toys (he refuses to throw toys away). He prefers their company to that of people. I don\u2019t even know if he has friends. He certainly avoids his college peers. He has dinner alone and goes to sleep early (I bet it is only to avoid us too). He only goes out if he needs to get a book in the library or if he has to go to college. Otherwise, you\u2019ll find him home. Is he afraid to become an adult? Could that be the reason he behaves like a child despite being almost 20? Could he have social anxiety? Autism, even? Maybe Aspergers. Some symptoms coincide: \u2022 Difficulty to socialize and make friends; isolation \u2022 Rigid routines (he gets distressed if he can\u2019t follow them) \u2022 Fear of change (he doesn\u2019t want to throw old/broken things away) \u2022 Hygiene issues (he rarely showers and shaves and he never uses deodorant) \u2022 Sensitivity to noises and light \u2022 Repetitive motor mannerisms (which he didn\u2019t have as a child) If he had autism, though, he would have some speech difficulties, wouldn\u2019t he? He actually uses sarcasm and understands it perfectly. Never shown any speech delay either. Besides, I think I read someone is born autistic, so he can\u2019t become autistic at the age of 18. It\u2019s been an evolution, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure what is going on. Is he just a very immature teenager or does he have a condition? (From Spain)",

I began masturbating when I was about 10, I didn\u2019t even know what was I doing, I didn\u2019t even know anything about sex or had any sexual feelings. I would lay on my stomach and just sort of pressure myself against the floor and I would never use my hands or finger myself, it has been the same way ever since. I am 20 years old, and I never get turned on by anything rather than humiliation and torture such as whipping and stuff. I learned that it\u2019s a sexual masochism disorder. However, this whole issue has been bothering me for so long, and I cannot just get convinced that I was born this way. The fact that I only feel aroused this way ever since I was a kid makes me mad, especially because it\u2019s not even associated with sex. It\u2019s not like imagining having sex in that kind of way, sex is never even a factor in this. Never. Sex and steamy scenes never make me feel anything. I even began thinking that maybe I was sexually assaulted or abused in general as a child. My parents were normal and good, though. But for example, as a child and a teenager and even now, I am depressed most of the time. I am also very reckless towards myself like in fifth grade I swallowed so many pills to die and it was for a stupid reason. I used to self-harm very deeply( not related to masochism), and there is so much other stuff. Lately, I have been trying to remember my childhood. We had a nanny for a few years when I was 6 or 7, I remember that I hated her so much, that I once held a knife and told her that I would kill myself if she didn\u2019t stop bothering me. I don\u2019t remember though what she used to do, I cannot even remember her face which is weird because I remember people and stuff from a stage much earlier than that in my life. I have also been bullied as a kid from my friends but not like physically or anything. I know it\u2019s stupid but I desperately want an explanation. (From Egypt)",

This includes heart palpation, trembling, numbing in hands and feet, fast breathing, fearful thoughts such as someone breaking in, ghosts creepy dolls you name it! I also sweat and feel extreme nausea the whole time. Because of this, trying to sleep is a problem as I can\u2019t stop thinking of the fear, I can\u2019t close my eyes for more than 5 seconds and if I want to sleep I have to have a video on and sometimes my lamp on though sometimes it is impossible to shut my mind off. It used to be much worse than now as I don\u2019t have it regularly and can kind of control it but i do have my days. From what I have googled I cannot find many people with the same problem. I also have experienced waking up with my whole body numb, with loud ringing in my ears heart pounding and difficulty breathing. It is like I am in a bag as I feel detached from reality. When it is over however it feels like it never happened (btw I can move a bit but very difficult) it has happened twice but it terrifies me . I also have no idea what that is and when I went to the doctor he was not helpful AT ALL. I have been to counseling but the problem has not been solved. I get very stressed easily and have my fair share of anxiety in the day too. I am quite a healthy in size yet I don\u2019t exercise and my diet could be better. I am just wondering what the fear at night is and if it may be possibly linked to stress during the day. Thanks a lot for taking your time to read this. (age 15, from New Zealand)",

        "Patient Question": "I have severe body dysmorphic disorder, GAD, bipolar disorder, and severe depression. BDD came around a time where I was also anorexic. I started to feel less than everyone because I was coming to terms with being gay also. Something I hate beyond words. The reason I\u201dm contacting is that i feel I\u201dm losing more and more grip of reality with every passing day but also have zero interest in wasting my time with therapy because there is no amount of therapy or no therapist who could convince me that it will ever get any better. To give you an idea, gay men message me all over the internet telling me I\u201dm fat and ugly, that I can\u201dt be gay because of it and many tell me to end my own life since it would be better since I\u201dm too fat and ugly and look like a pig. There is not one thing ANYONE would ever convince me to like about myself and being gay isn\u201dt a choice, I\u201dm tired of people telling me I should consider therapy when It never worked for me and since therapists cannot change that I\u201dm gay or that I look like this, WHY should I waste all my time and money going to therapy when there IS NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING, they can do to make any of this any better. There is no bullshit POSITIVE thinking that\u201ds going to not make me hate everything about myself or being gay. When you have spent almost the entire time you\u201dve been out (since 2007) being told that your life is worthless because of how you look means that PEOPLE will not get any better either. What should I tell people with the best ways why CBT is not effective for everyone. Not everyone also has 300 dollars sitting around to go to ONE therapy appointment that MAY OR MAY not work. Every day gets worse, but I know it won\u201dt ever get better with how they are. Why do you feel the pressure to oversell the effectiveness of treatment at the expense of well-being of the patient? So many therapists do not care and just want money. So many use themselves as a well for people to almost figure out their own issues. I went to school for Psychology too- it\u201ds become a joke.

This woman adopted me and groomed me as she had seen fit \u2013 that is into a housewife/sex kitten for my husband; which she picked out.

I won\u2019t get into too much detail. But she was very manipulative, controlling, and cruel. I felt like she had repressed homosexual urges that she projected onto me. For example, during a family event she was ready to leave and refused to do so unless I kissed her on the mouth. In front of everyone. Even though I felt uncomfortable. (And made others uncomfortable.) She used to physically groom me for dates or meeting her male friends by doing my hair, makeup, and how I dressed.",

        "Patient Question": "I am a co-facilitator (pro bono, unlicensed) for a men\u2019s DV group (court-mandated) at a non-profit. The leader is a therapist who also has a private practice. In group one of the men mentioned fear of losing his probation for something he didn\u2019t do and being imprisoned for years at an upcoming hearing. He didn\u2019t return to the group after the hearing. She discovered he indeed had been jailed with another hearing soon to determine whether he will be imprisoned. He\u2019s made enormous progress, despite a terrible childhood and adverse family dynamics, he has a good heart and reaches out to other group members, attends a drug-tested substance abusers group three times a week, and has focused on becoming a father again to his children (they were not the recipients of his abuse). But he\u2019s also expressed suicidal thoughts in the past in the context of never wanting to go back to prison, and he\u2019s become worn out and depressed in dealing with The System (frequent court hearings, probation officers, in-laws, etc. \u2013 you can imagine), and we\u2019re deeply concerned about his mental health. He\u2019s received no visitors. LA County is under a DOJ consent agreement to improve its mental health resources, but there have been numerous suicides nonetheless. The therapist is considering visiting the client in jail to check on his health and give him moral support, to let him know someone cares. But she and the non-profit center are conflicted about ethics and boundaries and dual relationships \u2013 she says this issue was never discussed in school or workshops, and the non-profit doesn\u2019t even have a policy because this issue has never arisen before. I think it\u2019s because the people setting boundaries aren\u2019t the kind of people who go to jail very often. A large proportion of the country\u2019s 2 million prisoners have some degree of mental illness and get almost no care. He hasn\u2019t called \u2014 he\u2019s expressed a sense of unworthiness that might keep him from calling. I don\u2019t think this is the usual ethics and boundaries issue, and I think in these circumstances the benefit for man\u2019s mental health and maybe even his life far outweighs the boundary risk.

I say this because while I\u2019ve experienced a lot of personal growth just within the past month, I can\u2019t help but have some concerns. I\u2019ll start by saying that this year has been a lot for me. I dropped out of college in May due to stress that inhibited me from functioning for months after (to this day I\u2019m still trying to get my life back), after months of persistent mood swings, anxiety, and mild psychosis I went to see a psychiatrist in September (I think) that completely dismissed my concerns by saying I had \u201cmild depression and terrible coping skills\u201d;despite me mentioning I\u2019d attempted suicide over 4 times!; which subsequently sent me into a severe depressive episode after the session. My mood never really lifted, and in November, 2 days before my birthday, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year. The experience in itself was gut-wrenching and the week following even more so. I had a really bad breakdown one night, broke a bunch of things, wanted to kill myself but blacked out before I could do any damage. I figured things would only get worse until the next week when my mood did a complete 180 and I suddenly knew the answers to life, the fact my ex wasn\u2019t talking to me no longer bothered me, I spent over $200 in 2 days (and the rest throughout the following week) etc. etc. (insert various symptoms of mania here). My therapist told me I seemed more bipolar than just depressed but it seems she dropped the diagnosis as she hasn\u2019t mentioned it since our first session and gave me a diagnosis of \u201canxiety disorder\u201d upon our second meeting. Anyway, the episode of what I\u2019d call mania lasted for basically a month up to the point I was certain I was god and was considering starting my own religion, but then on Christmas night depression slapped me in the face and I\u2019ve been very down ever since.

His problem is that he seems to completely believe that he can\u2019t do anything and that he is on the way out. Anything that we do to help him he is convinced is killing him. He will do nothing for himself and needs to be strongly encouraged to the point of pushing to do anything. By anything I mean eating, drinking, getting up, washing, going to the toilet, standing-up Etc. He will physically try to resist, shouts at the top of his voice \u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t\u201d, makes all sort of totally illogical excuses etc. He won\u2019t feed himself but although he shouts and says it\u2019s killing him, he will open his mouth and take the food. He cannot make any decisions, doesn\u2019t want to engage in conversation or talk to people. However with patience and when he is not being pushed to do anything he will answer questions, he will get involved in doing the crossword and will show some interest in the newspaper and TV. At these times it is clear that he has no loss of memory (over any time period) and is fully aware of what is going on. He is as good as anyone at the crossword and will make sensible comments about sport, current affairs etc. Even though he won\u2019t get up himself to go to the toilet, occasionally during the night he will. In the past he has been prescribed different anti-depressants but these just made him a zombie without any benefit. We have tried seeing a psychiatrist but he was not willing to open up and could thus not make any progress.

All I know is that whenever any random emotion has struck me, I\u2019m quick to thinking about killing. It used to be wanting to kill small animals with my step-dad\u2019s old hunting knife, but now it\u2019s progressed to wanting to kill people. Nobody really in specific, unless there\u2019s a person who has directly given me hell. Many people fake emotion every day, but I feel like I fake them all, except for anger. I want to use knives and sharp objects to sever a person\u2019s aorta, and I want to watch the lights in their eyes go out; I don\u2019t want it for the blood, I don\u2019t want it for any reason other than to kill. I can\u2019t explain it. The only thing close to this that I\u2019ve been able to find in my studies is sociopathy or sadism. Neither of these seem to fit me though, because both conditions usually include having some kind of sexual need. Sociopaths typically excessively masturbate, whereas I never have. Sadists usually yearn for a masochistic sexual partner to torture and humiliate, whereas I\u2019ve never wanted it. Sex has always been a thing that I find disgusting, messy, and unnecessary for recreation. I have a girlfriend who wants sex, and I\u2019ve always just had to act like I want it too, but honestly, I\u2019d rather be doing anything else than having sex. I seem to fit the profile of a sociopath because of the whole lacking empathy thing, but I don\u2019t rejoice (nor mourn) in the act of manipulating people for any reason. I don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s wrong so that I can get help \u2013 I just don\u2019t want to end up having to go to prison. I want to know how to control my urges before they control me.

Before I turned 10, my childhood was good and I have fond memories of my family hanging out / doing activities together. However, after reaching the age of 10, my father just stopped bothering to spend time with his children. Over the years he acts like he wants to hang out but when time rolls around for the activity to take place, always comes up with excuse to not hang out (be it family activities or spending time with individual family members). This obviously hurt my feelings as a child (mainly because I would try to follow things up) and he would always get angry at me. I\u2019m now a 29 year old adult, and he still claims to want to hang out from time to time. However I really don\u2019t believe him and get annoyed with this behavior because I know he won\u2019t follow through. Problem I have, is not that he won\u2019t hang out. If he doesn\u2019t value his family enough to spend time with them, that\u2019s fine. But he acts like everyone else is to blame for this (even though he suggests hanging out, and other people have to follow up to see if event is really taking place).",

I rarely ever bathe, brush my teeth or my hair, and I have LITTLE motivation to get dressed, and when I decide to do all of those things, I am probably going out in public or visiting some people, and MOST TIMES, I won\u2019t even do my hair or get dressed \u2014 I\u2019d just wait in the car and stay incognito. I rarely ever go out and I\u2019ve never had any friends in school. All the people that I\u2019ve known before are never interested in my friendship and I feel like there may be something wrong with me. I always hear the same excuses. I should be writing a book right now, but I never feel motivation to do that either. I feel like maybe if I had some friends that accepted me, that I\u2019d LIKELY go the extra mile and do all of these NORMAL things. Sometimes anxiety isn\u2019t enough to make me want to bathe and it can take me hours to get a SIMPLE TASK finished \u2014 because I am so slow and unmotivated! I feel happy when I do things I love \u2014 other than that, I\u2019m always bored or something. I\u2019m usually on the internet watching movies or listening to music, scrolling Facebook to see if I\u2019ve gotten a message from my ACTIVE friend. The only person I feel TRULY respects me, is someone from the internet.

She told us that, and we (her children ) supposedly don\u2019t know they fought. But as the months have gone by she has completely crumbled. She has many breakdowns on weekends when my father goes out. When she has these breakdowns, she talks in a really suicidal way. She tells us how she wants to die, how she feels guilty, how she wants things to go back, how she really just wants to disappear. She acts this way because since they fought, my father completely neglected my mom. He told her that she can\u2019t love her anymore and that he can\u2019t forgive her. So coming back to her breakdowns, it is really worrying to see her in that state, in which she cries for hours and hours until she calms down. As her children, who are young we can\u2019t really do anything for her other than give her a shoulder. But it has gotten to a point where she cries whenever she is alone. We don\u2019t know what to do anymore, because she has stopped eating or resting. My father\u2019s harsh words towards her really don\u2019t help her, because she still hopes he might love her one day. So we just are desperate, because we feel that hugging her is not enough to help her be happy again. So, I ask for advice because my mother\u2019s condition really just gets worse as days go by. What can I do for her to help her move on and find happiness because it really has affected me a lot. I love her and want her to be healthy and happy, not to feel like every day is more pain.

Her dad is schizophrenic & drug addict. She says she misses him often even though he was in jail for the 1st half of her life & they really haven\u2019t bonded. They don\u2019t spend much time together. Never unsupervised. Anyway when he got out of prison, he had 2 more kids with another girl. My grand loves that she has siblings. She also knows why she cant live with him/them. We figd. those kids would probably be taken from them at some point and thats what happened. Her dad OD\u2019d & they drug tested all of them. They both failed & CPS took the kids. They also had drugs in their systems. He is in a rehab now. Not sure about his girlfriend. They don\u2019t live close to us. My grand was expecting to see them last week for her half sister\u2019s first bday party. The paternal grandparents don\u2019t want her to know about any of this, but I don\u2019t want to lie to her. I want her to know she can trust us. I do know she\u2019s better not knowing every detail but I feel she can handle a PG version of the truth. She\u2019s been mature hearing other truths about her parents in the past. I really need some advice on what to do this time. Thank you!",

Since I was about 11, I\u2019ve struggled with periods of extreme sadness/anger that resulted with me cutting myself for a few years. I stopped around 14/15 years old. However, I still I experienced those episodes quite frequently and, despite my ability to refrain from self harm, they were still of the same magnitude. I struggled with suicidal thoughts, I\u2019ve had issues creating and maintaining relationships (for example, I did not make one new friend my whole first year at a huge college, but rather only talked to my boyfriend and a few friends from high school). Now, during the summer, I spend 95% of my time in my house (my parents don\u2019t want me with my boyfriend) and I can\u2019t reach out for professional help without my parents knowing because I\u2019m on their insurance. I wanted a summer job but no places around me wanted to hire workers just for the summer. Stigmas are killing me and my mother, who also suffers mentally/physically, makes it hard for me to leave, connect with others, and has an issue with me and my sister growing up and being independent. (Ex. My sister lives at home but is engaged and my mom gets mad if my sister sees her fiance too often but doesn\u2019t act this way with my brother and his gf). Is there any free online therapy or any free resources I can use to help me?

But when I tried to convince myself I had no depression I started feeling like I wasn\u2019t myself each time sliding from happiness to pain of depression and something traumatic happened to me that made me think all the time that I\u2019m just dreaming, I stayed this way for months.

Over the years I\u2019ve had issues, first insomnia when I was seven (couldn\u2019t stop thinking of the homeless sleeping under the rain). Always rebellious in school, I was diagnosed hyperactive and given ritalin when I was 10. I was later \u201cdisdiagnosed\u201d. I often refused to go seek therapy because I thought \u201cI\u2019m not crazy\u201d. I was in boarding school from 13-18, I was beaten up pretty badly when I was in my first year there because I disrespected the upper years. I had a couple of crushes throughout my life, none of which worked out or really mattered until a girl called Anna, my first love. She smashed my heart and got a boyfriend but I didn\u2019t give up leading to further pain and pushed me to drink a lot. I started smoking weed when I was 16, it started with a gram/week but gradually built up to 10g/week (4months ago). Recently, 1 month and a half ago, a friend fell in a psychosis, came out to me. I told him I was straight but respected his way. He asked me to teach him how to live, and tried to kiss me twice. I was so scared that night, locked myself in my room scared he\u2019d come rape me. For the following weeks I asked myself whether I might be gay and hadn\u2019t realized. It didn\u2019t bother me until one night after I hit a rough patch with a girl I love, and a friend said he thought I was gay as we were smoking. Henceforth I was convinced I was, for 3 weeks I kept smoking (5g/day by the end) thinking it would make it stop. When I got back to Paris I saw 2addiction experts and one psychiatrist, the first two said it was a bad trip and would pass with some time and antipsychotics. The second said it was anxiety related and triggered by weed-abuse.I then decided to get hospitalized and they said it was acute psychosis, sign of bipolarity or schizophrenia and that I could never drink or touch any drug again. I\u2019m unsure of who to believe or what\u2019s going on. I now know I\u2019m straight but I now fear I\u2019m suffering from the aforementioned illnesses. (From Paris)",

        "Patient Question": "My boyfriend and I just moved in together. Since we\u2019ve moved in together, he\u2019s been getting angry with me every day. It usually revolves around me being too quiet. The first time we were in the car and he started yelling at me for being too quiet, I then got even more quiet as I\u2019ve been in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship before (and that used to be the safest reaction) and then he started calling me names. I then had a panic attack, as I suffer from anxiety. Prior to meeting him, I hadn\u2019t had an attack for a year. He always calls me names when he\u2019s angry, and then when he\u2019s calmed down he apologizes and says he\u2019s sorry he\u2019s been a dick, but he loves me, and I just need to give him time to get used to me. I\u2019m starting to think that there\u2019s something wrong with me and it\u2019s my fault that he\u2019s angry at me all the time. I\u2019m walking on egg shells in our home and dread having days off work because he works 4am-11am so is home most of the day. He told me that he was sexually abused when he was younger, and I know that he has a \u201cfuck everyone else\u201d mindset, but he\u2019d never been that way with me. I start shaking every time he yells at me now. If I try to talk to him about it reasonably, he gets even angrier and says I\u2019m trying to blame him for everything when I\u2019m clearly in the wrong. The worst part is that I\u2019m a Detective and have worked in the domestic violence unit before and I should be able to recognize whether or not this is going where I think and feel it might be, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve never called him names, and have asked him to try not to do it when he\u2019s mad, but he hasn\u2019t stopped. He even says things like it\u2019s no surprise I was single when he met me, I\u2019m lucky because there are men out there that would be worse, etc. I don\u2019t know what to do, or if it will get better.

But occasionally when I get angry I lash out physically, so I\u2019ll hit walls or pull on my hair but I\u2019ve never hurt anyone and it\u2019s always been in private so no one knows this has been happening. About a month ago my girlfriend told me something that made me angry. I could feel myself getting angry and started to pace around her room, she could she I was distressed and got up to comfort me but in that moment I needed space so I pushed her away onto her bed. She wasn\u2019t hurt she was just shocked. I hadn\u2019t even realised I\u2019d done it. Anyway I calmed down in the end and we\u2019ve carried on as normal. But recently we spoke about the incident again and she told me that she\u2019s now constantly afraid to get me angry in fear that I might hurt her or go further than just pushing her away. I love her and she\u2019s the last person I want to hurt and it kills me that I\u2019ve given her a reason to think these things. I just wanted to ask the question here firstly to see if you think this is a serious anger issue that would benefit from speaking to a therapist or going on a course or something. And if there\u2019s anything I can do in the meantime to make things better. Maybe techniques that can calm me down. I genuinely don\u2019t think I could ever hurt her, she is the most important thing in the world to me. But it scares me that I didn\u2019t realise I had pushed her. All I want is to be someone that she feels safe around and to be the best I can be for her. Any help of advice would be much appreciated. (age 18, from US)",

Hi, I\u2019m 17-year-old girl and I\u2019m worried that I might have Asperger\u2019s syndrome and some other illness, but I don\u2019t know which one. Firstly, I want to say that I always knew that I\u2019m different from others. even when I was little I had trouble to fit in because I didn\u2019t know how to normally communicate. every time I meet people I don\u2019t talk or I talk like a crazy. I also dress up little different, so every one first thought is that this girl is weird. I have had 5 friend in my life and now just left two. others grew up like normal kids so I became too weird for them. even when I was in first grades in school teachers were forcing others to talk with me because when other were playing I was just drawing, not even paying attention. I\u2019m not even going to mention my obsessions, weird talks about subjects that no one cares about. everyone was calling me philosopher. I also could never consider someone\u2019s eyes I just improved that a year ago. also, I show many other symptoms except maybe not understanding what are people telling me. sometimes my grandma and mum tell me that I\u2019m like a brick not understanding what people tell me but I don\u2019t really know why are they saying it. this is my suspicion about Asperger, but what I really worry about is delusions. when I was 14 or so I was convinced that I am a werewolf even though I don\u2019t believe in them. I believed it so much I would do stupid things like I would eat raw meat (which is funny because I don\u2019t like meat), having dreams about me shapeshifting and if I would discover little scratch next morning it was because it really happened. I even had \u201challucinations\u201d. in the mirror, I could see my eyes turning yellow. it was much worse than it sounds. this ended in a year or 2. but then next started. I believed I was a medium and I was literally seeing auras and ghosts (which is also funny because I don\u2019t believe in them). I could hear voices and breath. and this ended in a few months. there is something about aliens but I don\u2019t consider it important. PS parents don\u2019t believe me. There are other things too but I\u2019m over word limitation. (From the USA)",

At times, I seem to incorrectly read people\u2019s emotions, whether spoken or not, and I tend to get angry and frustrated when there is no need to be.

To put it simply, my girlfriend has BPD with the three extra disorders, Eating, Depression, and anxiety. After 9 months I\u2019m really struggling to find the love in the relationship. One month ago I did something awful to her that was related with my PTSD, and now I\u2019m just trying to pick up the pieces because of guilt. Because of my desperate behaviors, I\u2019m worried that she has taken this opportunity to control me. Currently, there is a lot of me giving to her and not receiving the same effort back. There are a lot of fights and daily depression that effects both our lives heavily. I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out if I should break up with her because the BPD has become too overwhelming and manipulative. I can\u2019t even play guitar anymore because she thinks that me learning will compromise her identity that has latched onto her guitar skills. All of my hobbies are now competitions in her mind. I love her extremely, but all of this daily drama is killing us. I think it just comes down to figuring out if there is a future for us anymore.

That all started with a intimate happy new year wish text of a friend of my dad. I was suffering from paranoid for 3 months though I didn\u2019t have any, any clues expect them texting and my mother deleting his texts. (which just happened 3 times) Then I talked to my mother and found out how silly I were. I was so ashamed of my paranoia. It ended there but a few days ago me and my mom were on a trip and she bought a box of a not special cookie. She didn\u2019t mention for who she bought that and when I told here these cookies are not delicious, she told me they\u2019re fine to bring to work for colleagues. (I also remember earlier she has told me that she has to buy these, and I\u2019m not sure if she mentioned that sb asked her to buy them for him/her or not) When packing, she also kept the store\u2019s bag. and that was when I remembered she didn\u2019t want her colleagues to know she was on a trip. The paranoia started. It couldn\u2019t be for the colleagues. All of the terrible feelings from last year came rushing to my head. Does she have a secret friend? She didn\u2019t buy anything worthy (but she did buy some expensive gifts for my father) but the idea of my mom buying a gift for a man had made me desperate since we\u2019re back.

When I was in 4th grade I was diagnosed with ADD and I\u2019ve have had on and off depression, disordered eating habits, and anxiety since then but I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 3 months ago. Lately I have been feeling very disconnected and can\u2019t stop zoning out, when I\u2019m not zoned out my vision is distorted. Everything looks like its shifting, breathing, certain things pop out a lot, and when I read text it waves and spirals into itself.

I did do LSD\u00a0twice about 5 months ago but I\u2019ve only been experiencing these symptoms for 2 or 3 months so it\u2019s not because of the acid. I question reality and get confused about the concept of time and sometimes I completely forget who I am. Also been having bad insomnia and strange sleep patterns.

        "Patient Question": "My older brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia 10 years ago. Before his psychotic break, we were close. After he got sick, I moved away for college and never moved back to my home state. For almost a decade, he\u2019d only communicate with me in person. He was afraid to use email or the telephone because he thought people were spying on him. We I did talk to him, depending on what meds he was taking, he might be talkative or might not speak at all. He\u2019s not really in treatment. He sees a psychiatrist every 2 or 3 months and takes a long term injection. That\u2019s all. Other than that he never leaves the house. Technically he\u2019s been medicated for 10 years, never off antipsychotics, but his delusions are always a problem. He still believes that certain people have betrayed him and tried to ruin his life. So I can\u2019t say he was ever recovered or stable. His psychiatrist is aware of his ongoing delusions. In the beginning I encouraged my parents to get him to see a psychologist or other therapist and work out a treatment plan. They said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d So it never happened. Now I\u2019m not close with my brother. He\u2019s missed much of what happened in my life over 10 years, including my wedding because he didn\u2019t want to go out of the house. My parents are trying to get us talking more. They use group text or Facetime. At first it was strained, and a year later I feel like I just don\u2019t like the guy anymore. I don\u2019t like the way my brother acts now. He\u2019s rude, pushy, arrogant. He\u2019s always criticizing and belittling me. He tries to manipulate me into buying things for him online. He starts fights about politics that seem endless and he won\u2019t ever let them go (and we all have the same politics, we\u2019re all registered democrats, so I don\u2019t even know how we manage to fight). He never asks me about my life, job, husband, hobbies, house, town, etc. When I talk to him about my life he changes the subject. He only likes to talk about his interests (movies, politics, music). If I talk to a friend I haven\u2019t seen in 10 years, we catch up. My brother\u2019s not interested in that. It feels really one-sided. There\u2019s no give and take the relationship. I currently have health problems and my physician asked me to avoid stress. I just feel like it\u2019s impossible to do that with his toxic tantrums once a week. But I don\u2019t know how to tell my parents to just leave it alone, let us grow apart, we have nothing in common and just shouldn\u2019t be talking. If he was in REAL treatment maybe things would be different but he doesn\u2019t want things to change.

In fact, he was one of the only kids in class who didn\u2019t bully me, but maybe it was because it wasn\u2019t his type of thing. Anyway, about 4 years after I last saw him, I found out he died. That was about mid 2016. Today is July 2018 and sometimes I still stay up late at night saddened at the thought of him being dead. I feel silly to grieve someone i hardly knew and spoke maybe 3 words to the entire time I knew him. Sometimes I go through his old social media, and I see how normal of a kid he was. He made videos with friends, he wore silly costumes to get a laugh, and he was really loved by the people he surrounded himself with. I guess I\u2019m mainly saddened that he was only 17 and he had a family that he left behind. I\u2019ve cried so many times over this and I guess I just want to express what I\u2019ve been feeling to someone and be told that this is a normal process.",

        "Patient Question": "I have this issue since I was 9yrs old. When I was 9, I JUST used to make these characters in my head whenever i heard music and then make up a whole story in my head with music in the background. The music just had to be related to a story for e.g a story about a powerful queen story then the song \u201cThat\u2019s my girl\u201d But I used to this only when I heard the music. I didn\u2019t do them by purpose. But when I turned 13, I started to \u201cact them out\u201d as well. I used to do this a lot more than before (I\u2019d spent hours). I turned on music by purpose and then do it and I still do it now. I get inspired to do these stories when I see a movie or read another story. And I THINK music isn\u2019t the main cause of this\u2026.it happens even without music. I hate it because it wastes my time and stops me from studying. I can only control not to do this for only 1 day and then I start to do it again. My question: Can I stop this? If yes, then how? if no, then how can I at least reduce it up to just 2 hours? Is music the cause or is it natural? (From Pakistan)",

Lately, however, i have recognised how little i truely care for others or how little remorse i feel in any situation. I must comment that i do feel as if i have a certain love towards dogs and often at times feel anxious and shy in social encounters. This, however is mostly due to the fact that i am uncomfortable being around people and social encounters are often followed by explosive bursts of rage. My speculations have mainly arrived through the fact that i have noticed that i am distinctly socially different from everyone else, and often feel nothing when others around me are crying, laughing or chatting. I also have a strong urge to be in a position of power, always aiming to be in controll of people and their actions and to be ontop of social encounters, remaining one step ahead. This is often made difficult, however due to my inverted personality. I myself find it strange that i feel so jelous and so eager to be in control when i care so little about these people or the things they say and do. Although i have grew up in a loving, stable family, often find myself laughing at jokes and enjoying tv shows, and feel as if i could never hurt an animal (although i have no problem with hurting humans), is it possible that i have an anti-social behavioral disorder such as sociopathy?

        "Patient Question": "Hello, I\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for 7 years. I\u2019m totally in love with her and I followed her to NY when she landed her dream job a couple of years ago. Recently, she was fired for reasons here undisclosed. Obviously this was a gigantic blow for both of us. Since then, she\u2019s developed a series of behaviors that have led to me wanting to seek help here. In a nutshell, she has always been a sensitive and highly empathic person and she claims that she\u2019s been given a new calling from a higher being. She spends her nights now looking across the street at one of our neighbors, like in a movie, and with a video game controller, she follows what he\u2019s doing. She says that she is watching over him and that she will make his life better like this since he seems lonely to her. On top of this, she\u2019s fasting; only eating fruits and nuts during a certain portion of the day. All of it seems super calculated and ritualized in great detail. I come from an extremely religious family so I\u2019ve seen similar but never ever like this. And this doesn\u2019t correspond to any popular religion. I\u2019ll say that she has never exhibited behavior like this in all the time we\u2019ve been together. I\u2019m obviously extremely worried about her and on a selfish note, I miss her a lot because she doesn\u2019t seem to need or want me anymore. The other thing is that she seems totally lucid when I speak with her, but what she does seems not right of course. She has not yet lost her temper with me or lashed out at me though even when I try to get her to stop. And another thing is that she\u2019s extremely proud and distrustful of doctors so I\u2019m afraid that if I try to get her to see one, she\u2019ll break up with me. I\u2019m wondering if I could get advice on what to do? Is it okay to start a correspondence with a doctor behind her back and try things out to see if she gets better? For example, since I\u2019m a cook and she used to love my cooking, I\u2019m going try to at least get her to eat by making some of her favorites. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

She is still cracks jokes and tells bad puns- she still is a ray of sunshine but extremely shy and quiet when it comes to new people and strangers and will act like such until she gets to know whoever. She\u2019s extremely selective of who she wants to befriend, gets scared easily and struggles when a person approaches her and starts a conversation. She sometimes cries when ordering food and talking to strangers but she laughs through her tears and tries talking but other days, strangely- this can last weeks, she\u2019s just fine! She easily talks to whoever and joke around with strangers as if everything is she\u2019s just fine but things always end up back to how she was, quiet and shy. She\u2019s always tired, she sleeps so much she occasionally falls asleep in class also. She never wants to do anything,(-art) she looks tired all the time and doesn\u2019t take care of herself.

Mind you, I was well into high school and still find clues and symbolism where I know they certainly don\u2019t reside. But these do me no harm, really. The most harmful of these was an obsession with my weight. The fear of becoming fat slowly morphed to the fear that I was already fat and my perception was warped, which soon escalated to the accusation that everyone else was keeping what I really looked like from me, frequently dropping hints as a sot of inside-joke. The size on my trousers had been changed as well-an idea I knew was impossible, yet still entertained. Needless to say, I became obsessive over the intake and burning of calories. Then, a couple years later, a light clicked and I realized how delusional I was. Mind you, the weaning process was slow and steady-it took months before I could drink juice without becoming anxious-but self-awareness is the first step to recovery. I\u2019m learning, unfortunately, that this is an issue which doesn\u2019t simply disappear. As of late, I\u2019ve become aware of those same vain whispers. They are beginning to resurface and though they aren\u2019t as loud as before, they seem to be getting harder to ignore. In October of last year, my family and I went on a picnic, to which I wore a sort-of-midriff. When my mother sent me the pictures she\u2019d taken, I had so much anxiety I cried. It was such a dreadful panic. I thought I was over my fear of weight-gain, but something as simple as a picture set me off. Logically, I know I\u2019m thin, yet I can\u2019t fully convince myself. These thoughts have been building, and I\u2019ve been trying to ignore them, but it isn\u2019t working.

He said that he wanted her to take him hostage and use him for her pleasure. He wanted to serve her. He said that he enjoyed strap-on play, golden shower, boot, foot and rear-end worship. I am so shocked by all of this and am trying to look for answers as to why and how someone develops fetishes like this. With me he is most gentle and loving and this is a completely different person than the one I know. Please help me to understand this. Does this mean he is gay or bi-sexual? Is he deeply disturbed?",

Ever since I was very young I\u2019ve had strong urges to harm living things and even myself. I seem to like all things involving pain harm and blood. I\u2019ve harmed myself several times in the past but not usually for suicidal tendencies but for fun, I try my best not to anymore. The thing that also concerns me is the fact I have terrible nightmares and very long and strange dreams/nightmares often having me hallucinate even after I wake up from the dream in the middle of the night. That has caused me to dread night time and being alone at home and the darkness (I sleep with a lamp on because of this). I\u2019m often paranoid but I love to watch all things horror and dark so that doesn\u2019t really help my situation either but I can\u2019t seem to stop. I am always paranoids at night and feel as if something is out to get me and that would cause me to stare at something like the door or the mirror because I find it bad and I\u2019d have a hard time falling asleep because of it sometimes as well.",

I didn\u2019t get into any good colleges for it and am currently going to a school that is not good in my theatre major and is not the right degree type. I have been very unhappy here, with both the program and the school itself. This year I applied and auditioned for more schools to transfer to and got into a really good school that\u2019s 8 hours away from me. There has always been a part of me that\u2019s doubted whether or not I really want to do musical theatre for my life, but this year that part of me has gotten so much bigger. I\u2019m not passionate about it anymore, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the program or not. The school I\u2019m going to now is 40 mins away from me and I\u2019m able to come home most weekends, but I\u2019ve still had a really hard time adjusting and leaving everything behind. I just miss high school and my friends and my old life when everything was easy and simple. I used to have my whole\u00a0life planned out but now I just don\u2019t know and can\u2019t see myself doing anything. I tell myself it doesn\u2019t really matter because I\u2019d always planned to kill myself by the time I was 30 anyway. It would be a huge mistake not to go to this school because it\u2019s an amazing opportunity, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m making the wrong decision with my life. I also applied to a huge state school that\u2019s 10 mins away from me and I could commute to and 50% of my high school goes to. My parents don\u2019t know about this. They don\u2019t have much of a theatre program at all. I could go there and live at home, but not major in theatre. By going there, though, I would be giving up what I think is my dream and I\u2019m afraid trying to cling too much to my old life. I have 1 month to make this decision, and I\u2019m 99% sure I\u2019m going to go to the school that\u2019s 8 hrs away. I\u2019m so scared though because I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s what I really want, but I don\u2019t want to throw my life away doing an ordinary everyday job.

My career choice, gender identity, mannerisms, the stories and jokes I tell, the way I dress, my sense of humor- everything.

His mother began emailing jokes to my fianc\u00e9 and me and we noticed that there were a couple other people on the emails including an ex girlfriend, who he dated for a short period of time. My fianc\u00e9 asked his mother if she was still in contact with her and she said yes that they email occasionally. He told her that it made him uncomfortable and thought that it was disrespectful to both he and I and that it would hurt my feelings. She responded very harshly by saying she wouldn\u2019t be told who she could talk to. And that if I was that fragile than she would never be close to me any way because she would not want to have a relationship with someone that she needs to sensor what she says because of my feelings. She then deleted me from her email contacts and kept the ex. She said that she would also be a friend with another ex-gf, who had been very rude and nasty to me early on in our relationship, if she was given the chance. I felt like the response was totally irrational, mean and disrespectful. I felt extremely hurt. Her response hurt even more than the actual emailing itself. I had always been very nice and respectful of his mother. My fianc\u00e9 has been very supportive and says that he would feel just as hurt and uncomfortable if the tables were turned and it were my mother behaving in this manner. All we wanted was for some respect for our feelings. It hurt to see this relationship flaunted in front of me and then to have my future mother in-law blatantly not care less about our feelings and choose to maintain a relationship with the ex and not her future daughter in-law.

It was just her and I there and she had to use the bathroom. She went through and shut all of my bedroom doors and checked to make sure that no one was in the house because she was afraid that someone would see her in the bathroom. She is also a depressed person and real hard to get along with. She has a daughter,her name begans with the same letter as mine and when we are all together she gets our name mixed up she calls her daughter by my name and just keeps doing it. My mom babied her and always has. All of my brothers and my one sister know she has a problem but we are not sure what it is. She drives all of us crazy,its hard to be around her. She is always asking my brother if he is mad at her because she thinks that he isn\u2019t talking to her enough. She always wants pitty. She is a single mother and doesn\u2019t work and expects her family to keep her. She has trouble taking orders at jobs because she gets mad.

I\u2019m about to enter college and this hasn\u2019t stopped. What makes it worse is that I am a girl. I was dealing with it until the other day my mom pulled me by my shirt almost that I choked and led me to my room where my dad was present. I tried to escape but my dad pulled me by my legs several times that my body aches still. I tried to get out but he tried to remove my clothes all while my mom was still present. I don\u2019t understand what to do. There is no one in my house who still loves me anymore. I stopped eating and no one even came to check on me.

Until now, I always feared going to the gynecologist, thinking s/he may find out about what I had been doing or even find that I was pregnant (despite the fact it was years before I had had my first period). The problem is, I don\u2019t know what really happened. I cannot remember anything else about the incident and when I was younger I also had nightmares about it, making me question whether it had been a nightmare all along. Plus, I would have been between 5 and 10 years old when it happened (I have some issues with my childhood memory) and the guy from this scene was from my class. He was, at most, 1 year older than me.

This has been happening for over 17 years. She is currently 43. During this time she gets extremely violent with me and my father, has trashed our house many times and fought with anyone- neighbours, police, etc. We have always suspected that it was more than pms, she\u2019s practically an alcoholic and her behaviour isn\u2019t cyclical as you would suspect from pms. Over time, her mental health has been getting worse. She has been on less benders in this time, however she is never happy. She is constantly stressed- even though there is no stress to worry about. She doesn\u2019t take jokes, and we all have to choose our words very carefully in day to day life to avoid her going off. She has two other daughters under the age of 7, both of which she does not mother like a normal mum does. There\u2019s distance and not much love. She has odd behaviour, like going shopping for groceries every day and buying things we don\u2019t need. She associates herself with people who drink a lot of alcohol, so that when my father refuses to buy her any more she has someone to go and drink with. My father and I are under the impression that she may have an undiagnosed mental disorder like bipolar or schizophrenia (along those lines) and because her condition seems to be worsening with time, i wanted to reach out for an opinion. My family can\u2019t live like this anymore. It\u2019s unfair on all of us, and her. She is convinced that her issue is pms, so it would be hard to convince her to get help without premise such as advice in this forum. the drink will kill her one day, unless she stops.

She would joke around with me and touch me between my legs and I would always laugh because she convinced me that this was all in good fun. I was around the ages of 4 or 5. She never did this around my mother, though. Only when we were alone on the bed. Does this count as molestation? My therapist thinks it does, but I\u2019m not sure. Maybe I am in denial? I\u2019m 23 right now and thinking about all of this is making me a wreck and making me see my grandmother in a different light (I still live with her and my mother, by the way).

He finished school two years ago\u201d . He was never an outgoing person but he did have friends from his school days. Starting from last year he\u2019s been undergoing ever more increasing depression. At first he was only feeling down sometimes, but now he doesn\u2019t speak, even when directly spoken too. He doesn\u2019t talk about his depression with anybody, actually he doesn\u2019t talk with anybody at all nor does he leave the house at all. In the last few months he\u2019s even developed a tick (he sometimes inhales very quickly and loudly as if he\u2019s shocked). His lack of communication has made it impossible to get him professional help. He refuses any kind of professional care.

First off, I\u2019d noticed that she\u2019d lost quite a bit of weight since winter break, at least 15-20 pounds off an already slender frame. It wasn\u2019t just the weight, she hasn\u2019t eaten lunch at school these past months either, and whenever we eat out somewhere on the weekends she hardly touches her plate even though she only orders a salad. Also, she always quickly types on her phone before eating \u2014 this is what compelled me to go on her notes, just to see if there was anything, and there was. She has a folder documenting her height and weights, morning and evening, with exact times, from the past 6 months; 5\u20194\u2033 she started at 120lbs and is now down to 105lbs She also has weights labeled GW and UGW- 100 and 97, respectively. She has a folder in which she\u2019s typed up rules for herself varying from \u201cconsume 200-800 calories daily\u201d and \u201cfast once a week\u201d, to \u201cexercise 30- 90 minutes 6X/week\u201d. Also she has one labeled food journal but I didn\u2019t get to look at it because I didn\u2019t want to arouse suspicion for taking too long. Seeing this has shocked me, and since then I\u2019ve been paying closer attention to her, and there\u2019s something else that I find alarming, although I\u2019m not sure what exactly it means. I glanced at her hands last week and saw that not only are her fingernails chewed, the skin around her cuticles and knuckles is torn up and bloodied in some areas. I\u2019ve realized that she\u2019ll pick at the skin and sometimes even bite it- the nails AND skin. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. I am fairly certain she has an eating disorder, but what is this other biting thing and why? It looks very painful. I feel like I need to tell someone about these things, like her parents or the nurse, but I don\u2019t want to lose her as a friend, I love her and I don\u2019t want her to hate me for betraying her trust, especially if she realizes I went through her phone. How can I help her without damaging our friendship? (age 18, from US)",

        "Patient Question": "It has been more than a year now , I feel alone, depressed, don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone, just like to be alone. Also have been too much emotional these days. I don\u2019t have any girl friend or even a person who cares for me , except my mother, in my entire life. This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low. I am confident when it is work, but when colleagues go for tea break or lunch together I am uncomfortable to go with them as I don\u2019t know or I am not confident on my behavior. I don\u2019t sleep well, I stay awake late nights, get up late in morning. I have lost weight not eating much. Also about my past , I am not been able to do much friendship in school and college as well. Even in my family I have always been kept aside for all important things, they just think that I cant do it just because I don\u2019t speak much. I am fed up of all these, these days and I am seeking for an advice or help. It would be glad if someone can talk to me or can help me to find way out of this. Thanks in advance !!

That caused me to subconsciously move away from him and i started to focus on other men & in the end i cheated. We had a very bad break up and even though i ended things It left me depressed where from time to time i would suddenly burst into tears. Or not shower for a week and just lay in bed.

I asked him if he thought we would ever get back together. And he said that he didn\u2019t think we could rekindle the relationship, which is why I tend to leave him alone. I\u2019ve been in other relationships after him. And We communicate from Time to time to say happy birthday etc. But I do still think about him even in my current relationship.

My problem is that I\u2019m worried that I don\u2019t have any values or interests anymore. I used to follow a moral code, I was christian and rather conservative but liberal on some issues. I loved to read and create my own opinion on many topics. During high School, which was the worst time in my life, I have changed completely. Besides becoming first an atheist, than a satanist, I have also lost all of my interest in studying or making friends. We\u2019ve had a teacher who spend a lot of time telling us that there is no good or bad, that everything in life is relative. I believed in everything she said, reading all the books she recommended but now as years have past, I really can\u2019t live with myself anymore. Nothing matters to me, genocides, war, politics in general seem to be unimportant. I know it;s weird but I don\u2019t feel like a human being anymore, I used to care for others, I wanted to change the world, help those in need but ever since I went to high school I feel like I\u2019m just a body without a soul. I regret having my moral walls crushed by this teacher, and I regret the satanist phase and I would love to get back to my old self but I\u2019m trying for years now and nothing really changes. If someone could explain what may have caused this change in my character and give me tips on how to find my old self back, I would really appreciate it. And sorry for my bad English, it\u2019s a foreign language to me.",

We decided to go to France after highschool (we were 18) and study robotics and then later on founded an NGO about education. I have so much fun learning on my spare time with him all about robotics, and child psychology, how to create workshops to teach children about technology at a young age. All was good except my studies. I never graduated from my associate degree in mechanical engineering and that\u2019s when the lying started. I lied to my family back home in Morocco and I\u2019ve been lying to him. I told everyone that I graduated and that I was enrolled in a Masters of engineering. Trouble came when I had to apply for a renewal to my residence permit in France. I couldn\u2019t provide grade reports so I was refused the stay and had to go back home. That\u2019s when I told my best friend the truth. My mum found out after I got home. The problem now is that there are still people (friends) in my life that I\u2019m still lying to. I\u2019m currently enrolled in an engineering degree in Morocco (after 2 years of only focusing on creating the NGO I mentioned and working with my best friend who didn\u2019t give up on me and slowly got me out of my little depression).

I thought that this is what THC caused me to feel like (Never did it before). Next day I was fine but I found out my co-worker has passed away due to heroin overdose.

        "Patient Question": "So, in early October of 2017 I was suffering from intrusive/homicidal thoughts. Basically, I wanted to shoot up my school. I told an ex-friend about it and now I regret it. I\u2019m so afraid she\u2019s going to tell my school or someone in general and the fear is ruining my life. To clarify, I do not have these thoughts or urges anymore. At the time I was extremely obsessed with school shootings (for example: columbine). I think it is what encouraged me to think these things but what also encouraged me is the fact that I hated myself. I\u2019ve always been insecure. I have never been good enough and it caused me to want to take out my anger on others. My home life is good and I do not get bullied which makes me feel worse about having these thoughts. I feel selfish and stupid. A girl on Instagram even messaged me at one point, asking me if I wanted to participate in carrying out a school shooting and I said yes (I never went through with it and I told her no later on). I just felt like I had nothing to lose. I had anger towards myself which led me to have anger towards others. I regret ever having these thoughts and this haunts me every day. I feel like I\u2019m carrying around this huge secret and it\u2019s ruining me. I feel like if everyone knew they would resent me. This whole situation has also caused me to self-harm again after being clean for a while. I hate myself for ever wanting to hurt anyone. The pain I\u2019ve felt from this is unbearable. I\u2019ve thought about suicide but I\u2019m determined to feel better. I want to forgive myself, forget, and move on. Your advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.",

We decided to go on a break and just put our relationship on hold for awhile. This was hard because we live in the same apartment. We were like this for about 2 weeks then we actually broke up. After we broke up she spent everyday hanging out with this other guy and about 7 days after we broke up, they had sex. I asked her about it and she said that she didn\u2019t like it and all she could think about afterwards was being with me. We didn\u2019t get back together but things were getting better between us.",

Eventually I became very scared of what was going on to me and I started crying and he told me it might be a way that my body just shut down so I wasn\u2019t able to feel anymore.

        "Patient Question": "Is there a list available of character traits, habits and/or actions which would indicate in a general sense a psychological issue? ie: The person never shows embarrassment. The person hoards candy in the dresser drawers, under the bed, etc. The person is moody: sometimes depressed, angry, sulks or broods. The person never accepts responsibility or blame for wrongdoing but always blames others for whatever happens. If a glass is knocked over and spills or breaks, \u201cit fell\u201d. The person is slightly dyslexic, especially with numbers. Once the idea for a specific item wanted is in mind, that item will be had, no matter how much time elapses; it is not forgotten. The person does not tell jokes and rarely laughs at the humor of others. Most often the person does not understand the punchline of a joke. The person often acts as a victim. ie: purchases the wrong product because the correct one was out of stock, will be nearly driven off the road because will not use the horn, etc. In speech the person often attaches 2 totally/nearly unrelated phrases together using the word \u201cbut\u201d. There is nothing perfect; there is something wrong/negative in everything/everyone. Nearly always there is some minor ailment: a pain here, ache there, headache, bellyache, blurry vision, etc., seemingly in contrast/competition to others who are experiencing serious medical conditions ie: hip replacement, cancer, etc. The person does not seem to understand limiting physical teasing such as pinching by saying,\u201dThat didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d or \u201cI barely touched you.\u201d The person wants everyone to recognize and be generous at birthday and other special times of giving but is not generous personally. Gifts are often not age related/appropriate such as giving a small child-sized gift to an older adolescent or teenager. The person prefers to use the walk-in bank lobby vs the drive thru because it \u201cmakes them feel important.\u201d The person is not a deep thinker, does not have plans for nor talks about desires for the future. The person does not stay on task well and seems to be easily distracted from the task at hand. The aforementioned are quirks to the negative. The person has many positive characteristics as well, however, that is for another discussion. Thanks. (From Guatemala)",

These are feelings and thoughts I can\u2019t seem to get rid of and it\u2019s really scary. Is this anxiety? Depression? Panic attacks?

It\u2019s something that I can\u2019t really get rid of no matter how hard I try. I don\u2019t like these thoughts because I know none of the things my brain is telling me to fear/get irritated by/hate is going to harm me, so why do I feel this way about certain things for no absolute reason?

Another thing is that he was in a committed relationship for 5 years and I\u2019m worried of it\u2019s consequences cause after all he has obviously more experience in sex life or better say emotional life than me, which this affects our relationship. Another thing is that I think he seems like a bit abusive but I can\u2019t prove this because when I said I\u2019m virgin he totally agreed not having sex. yet, I feel like I have intimacy problems with him cause he can\u2019t satisfy me completely emotionally and I really don\u2019t know how to bring up this important issue\u2014while I\u2019m too shy still with him and can\u2019t open up easily about emotional stuff between us. another thing which is blowing my mind is that, does he really like me\u2014or its just for getting laid, making out and \u2026 I do like him. he is funny, in great shape, so active\u2026 but when it came to emotions I didn\u2019t get what I expected.

He let her stay in his house while between apartments after getting evicted, but then stayed 8 months longer while all the kids lived there and she continued to collect child support and stay overnight with her new bf. She has bad credit and dogs so this was her excuse for not being able to find a home. When he insisted that she leave she got angry and left her dogs behind. This is the second set of dogs she has abandoned and one set has lived with my bf for 7 years now. He refuses to keep another two dogs and has told her she must take them. Her solution was to take them to the shelter with his 14 year old son, telling him his father was forcing her to do it, that his father is selfish for not letting her leave the dogs \u201cfor just another few weeks.\u201d My bf\u2019s son, who is a \u201cyoung\u201d 14, is sad and angry at his father, which is typical of these scenarios. This isn\u2019t, as you might imagine, just about the dogs \u2013 boundaries that are enforced are punished through the kids. I encourage him to keep strong boundaries and he does increasingly so. In the big picture, I think it is the right thing to do for him and his children, but the stress of these constant \u201cpunishments\u201d is making him physically sick. He spent years bending over backwards so as to keep some kind of relationship with his children, but they are older now (and he is late 50s and exhausted) and is really trying to change the dynamic. Yesterday, she stole his EZ pass out of his car and had her oldest daughter text him that they needed to go on a college visit (note that she already receives 40k a year post tax for the kids, works part time, so desperate for $ is kooky). I would call the police for even small infractions to make a point, but my bf knows only his kids will suffer and he just can\u2019t stand to watch.

        "Patient Question": "My wife (age 39) has past history of depression followed by several months\u2019 therapy long time back. Lately once every year for the past 3 years for about a period of 2-4 months each year, she has been showing some severe behavioral responses to stressful situations. For normal people, these may not seem stressful situations usually, like house hunting, work load at college, arguments among couples, etc. But often when the stress remains for several days, especially with doing something new, she starts showing various reactions, like sadness, complete change in personality from a jovial one to a quiet depressive one, with a constant facial expression showing emotional hurt, withdrawal from normal activities, complete loss of sexual drive, aversion of eye contact, responding in frustrated way to normal questions, irregular sleep or lack of sleep, irregular eating schedules, complete lack of compassion. Taking one example, she started studying with a seemingly normal mood. She was unable to find a word for her work, which made her extremely frustrated. Even my inability to help with that word was met by seeming skepticism as if I wasn\u2019t actually trying to help. After 3 hours, she got up with a sad expression, complete silence, averting eye contact, and saying good night in a frustrated dejected way and retiring for the day. On normal days she is a very loving person, but she is not a threat to anybody even during the bad days. However, her reactions were more severe 3 years ago, with tendencies to cry all day, sitting in the dark corner of a room, shivering, inability to talk, facial spasms. These don\u2019t happen often and is never visible to anybody outside home. But there is always an underlying chance that any severe condition or normal arguments may trigger her reactions. Somehow, such stressful situations arose exactly once each of these 3 years, and hence that many reaction phases. However she is smart and completely aware of everything and hence not willing to see a professional. My question: What exactly is it that can be going on with her?Is there a name for this?Are there materials that I can read and show her to persuade her to take help? Is there really a treatment? Is it actually a disorder or something else? Please help. This affects daily life and normal relationships at home. (From the USA)",

I thought it would be okay even though I knew they didn\u2019t agree with that lifestyle but I didn\u2019t know just how much they thought it was wrong. Before I came out to them they were easy going and even though my mom yelled a lot we all seemed to get along well enough. I had a blog, was on lots of different social media sites and talked to all kinds of people. After I came out my parents immediately started having \u201ctalks\u201d with me. They put me down, told me to not live that lifestyle and that I would never be happy. I listened even though I didn\u2019t agree. Eventually after a few weeks of this my parents sat me down and told me they had been through all my social media, including the private ones, my friends accounts (which were also private but my mom majored in computers and was able to get into them) and eventually they found out through these sites that I liked my best friend and she liked me. To a lot of\u00a0our close friends we were dating, me and this girl but I had kept it secret from my parents knowing they wouldn\u2019t approve. Me and my girlfriend had only ever kissed twice at this point and hadn\u2019t gone far at all but my parents completely freaked out. They made me delete all my social media, break up with my girlfriend and they took all my electronics, including a simple tablet I used for drawing. They told me which friends I could keep and deleted anyone else who they didn\u2019t like (for any little reason) out of my contacts. I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to people for weeks and I wasn\u2019t allowed to hang out with anyone almost at all. I\u2019ve gone to them many times and told them they are being too controlling and I even broke down during one of our \u201ctalks\u201d and told them I\u2019ve been depressed and self harming a little but they haven\u2019t seemed to care. All they\u2019ve cared about is that I\u2019m nowhere near that \u201calternative lifestyle.\u201d Sorry this probably is a pretty dumb problem but it\u2019s making me depressed and hate them.

They didn\u2019t get that mad but told me I couldn\u2019t play it anymore. The problem is that now that I never play it anymore I feel a very strong need to play it and since no other game can replace it I feel unhappy and unfulfilled. When I actually write it out the first time it sounds really pathetic but it\u2019s actually quite a big problem. I wasn\u2019t very happy with my life before but video games was an easy way to cope with other things (when I say cope I don\u2019t mean through extreme violence like in GTA\u2019s case, more like a person who really likes soccer and uses that). The reason my parents won\u2019t let me play it is because of the mature content but I\u2019m not interested in the sex and drugs and the violence is unrealistic enough not to affect me at all. To be honest I don\u2019t really feel anything special when for example killing people in video games. I\u2019ve done a lot of research and I like to think that I know more than most people about psychology and I\u2019m very sure that I\u2019m not a psychopath nor narcissist. An example from the game is this one scene involving torture which I found pretty hard to get through. I\u2019m also quite intelligent for my age and has scored 121 on an IQ test, I\u2019ve also got really good grades and stuff so I think that that\u2019s maybe why I\u2019m not affected by violence I know is fake. I\u2019ve also already done pretty much everything in the game and seen almost everything in it in movies and tv series, so I kinda feel like I\u2019ve seen everything and that all potential damage is already done. My parents have also said that you shouldn\u2019t take chances and that I may get affected even though I didn\u2019t before. That may be but I\u2019ve actually begun to feel really depressed and sad most of the time and I know that there\u2019s no other way to fix it.

However, I have always been someone that makes friends easily, I never have any issue with anyone and generally I would say I\u2019m pleasant person. But for some reason some of his school friends were not welcoming to me. perhaps I was seen as an outsider, (I\u2019m European), or as someone a bit different. but me and him are very happy together. Over the years I\u2019ve heard from some of his friends that they had \u201cheard I was a horrible person and heard bad things about me from other people\u201d, and the people were always people I\u2019d never met, and it was just girls or bitchy people that my bf went to school with.

I have tried to confront my friends, they denied it but a part of me thinks if they actually are conspiring against me then that is exactly what they would say. Something else that might be related (I\u2019m not sure) is that I don\u2019t really speak to anyone at school after I confronted my friends (I used to speak to people) I am just not very interested in talking to people who are out to get me.

The place we live is beautiful and I speak the language fluently however due to visa delays I haven\u2019t been allowed to work since moving here. Before moving here, he had always promised me a work permit would not be a problem at all. 1.5 years is a VERY long time to keep yourself busy doing volunteering, or getting to know the city, or exercising or doing all these things that people in my position are told to do, and believe me, I do all of these intensively. Bottom line however, those activities do not fulfill my inner ambitions in the long run. I had a very good paying job in my home country, and I simply can\u2019t stand being financially dependent on him anymore. I had lots of friends and here I know absolutely no one so we are together 24/7 \u2014 we have run out of things to tell each other. I\u2019m very outgoing, so I\u2019m always trying to make new friends, but at my age it\u2019s much more difficult to connect.. On top of it, he is excelling and experiencing huge success in his job, while I have become this wreck, a shadow of myself and have watched my self-esteem literally disappear. I feel I\u2019ve been reduced to being a cook, cleaner and errand-runner and I feel completely dumb and impotent because I do not have self-validating experiences. I have realized how I\u2019m trying to distance myself from him because I am just so angry at this situation he has put me in,I feel he deceived me. My patience has run out and I\u2019ve started to have some very negative thoughts. He has started to ask me to try for a baby but I feel that with a child in a place with no family I will have even less opportunity of finding a job. Recently, I was referred here to my dream job at my dream company and had a successful interview, however then HR informed me they were taking me out the process due to my visa situation.

        "Patient Question": "I\u2019m a 25 year-old male whose father and cousins have/had schizophrenia. I recently moved to Oregon, where marijuana is a legal drug, so I partake recreationally (3-4 times a week). I just started smoking marijuana when I was 24, and really didn\u2019t make it a regular thing until I was 25. I\u2019ve always had a slight fear of having schizophrenia, as I\u2019ve studied mental illness since it\u2019s been a very big part of my life. Recently, however, I feel those feelings have been slightly amplified due to the correlative nature between schizophrenia and marijuana usage displayed in medical and psychological studies. I\u2019ve noticed myself becoming paranoid when under the influence (a common thing, I know). That paranoia usually subsides after I rest, along with the influence of the drug. That being said, I\u2019ve been having some thoughts of being able to change the world. These thoughts occur heavily when I\u2019m high, but also sometimes happen when I\u2019m sober (only much less intense), and usually come in the form of being able to educate people about empathy and kindness (since I\u2019m a teacher and an actor). I\u2019ve also had moments where I try to empathize with people in order to understand what they\u2019re thinking, and maybe even try to \u201cread their thoughts\u201d in order to better connect with them. Do I truly believe I can? No. But I do think I can come close to identify how their feeling in order to better help them with their problems.

        "Patient Question": "My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost a year. I know that he is the man that I am going to spend my life with and I have no doubts about that. We live in his home with his parents and because they are not working we completely support them and pay for everything. His mom has a multitude of health issues and is in her 50s she hasn\u2019t worked in over 20 years. His dad is 46 and stopped working after hurting his knee at work when my boyfriend was 18. Since then my boyfriend has been supporting them completely. My boyfriend is a caring and loving man and his parents take advantage of him. They are not appreciative and always expect him to provide them with whatever they want\u2014his dad in particular. At first when I moved in things were okay but recently it has been very hard. His parents both smoke in the house and no matter how many times we talk to them about it, it continues. They are constantly in our business and wanting us to run and get them things. Recently his dad came into a decent amount of money and with that money he was supposed to buy a vehicle, he did not. Instead his dad takes my car almost everyday and is gone until it\u2019s time for me to go to work which just leaves me sitting at home. I want so badly to move out and have our own place just me and my boyfriend. But we cannot afford to pay for our own place and a place for his parents. My boyfriend is completely unwilling to wean his parents off of his support and I fear that we are going to be stuck living in the same home with them forever. We are only 25 and it feels like we are never going to have the chance to have our own family. I get so angry because his father is mostly just lazy and unwilling to work and would rather just have his son take care of him forever. He has the attitude of an unable elderly man when in actuality he is younger than my parents who both work. My dad had the same knee injury as him and got it fixed then went back to work. He didn\u2019t forever stay \u201cdisabled\u201d and expect me to take care of him. It\u2019s beginning to feel impossible living with them and I am so depressed and discouraged. I sit in my room all day long and avoid his parents because I feel uncomfortable and when I hear them complaining it makes me angry. Am I crazy for thinking we deserve a life of our own? And am I selfish for thinking that if we just moved his parents would figure it out? They aren\u2019t children, they\u2019re adults and I\u2019m getting really tired of caring for them like children and everyone I bring this up to my boyfriend he makes excuses for them and dismisses my feelings and just says he\u2019s sorry but that\u2019s just how it is.

At first when things would lead up to sexual he would get extremely nervous. Now he trusts me more and doesn\u2019t feel as self-conscious so it\u2019s easier to get things going where he used to stop me. He says he likes making me feel good. And he gets me to orgasm using his hand. We have intercourse but it doesn\u2019t last very long. He gets hard but then when we start doing it he slowly loses his erection. He says he doesn\u2019t mind that he doesn\u2019t need it but I don\u2019t know if I should just accept that and stop trying. Sometimes it makes me really discouraged that he doesn\u2019t get to feel good. It\u2019s not even just not getting off. When he\u2019s in me I\u2019ll ask him if it feels good and he always says a little which I think is just to spare my feelings. I don\u2019t believe it feels bad. Oral doesn\u2019t really do much for him either. I\u2019ve tried to just do a nice sensual hand job but he said it wasn\u2019t doing anything for him even though he got an erection he said he didn\u2019t even realize his body was responding. Like there is a disconnect between the physical and his mind. He did get off one time when we were having sex and he liked it, of course. I think we might have not used a condom then and I\u2019m going to look into better birth control so we don\u2019t need condoms. But what else can I do. He\u2019s said he might want to talk to a doctor but he\u2019s really embarrassed. Also, he\u2019s not that big and he does slide out a lot idk if that could contribute. He also is on antidepressants has anxiety and is afraid to get blood work done. We have a good time, I do believe achieve intimacy. He likes that I respond to him. He always tells me it makes him happy that he can make me feel like that. He loves kissing and cuddling.

I dont want to have these thoughts and would never act on them but I cant get rid of them and I am worried I will be branded or told I am going insane. I go into daydreams a lot which is when they usually occur and once I have thought them I realise what I have done and feel horrible.

He is 31 and he realizes that he has a problem; he has seen a therapist before Who did not give an analysis but asked him to attend therapy sessions which he was not able to attend due to his constant business trips. His problem is as follows: He has terrible temper issues, any simple thing which is not as per his expectation causes him to get seriously mad and as per him he says that he turns into a totally different person, he says things that he doesn\u2019t mean which kind of an emotional abuse to the other person, he does his best to hurt the person in front of him emotionally, and sometimes he hits anything in front of him -not people but things- he even hit his hand in the wall many times. I have witnessed some of his episodes and he says that this is nothing cause he tries to control as much as he can with me, but he seriously turns into another person. It takes him time to recover from his episodes based on the severity of the case and when he is better he doesn\u2019t even recall what he said or did, he just remembers that he has been the bad him and he definitely hurt the other, one thing he does is that he kind of blames others for this, like you know I\u2019m crazy so be careful and don\u2019t make me angry. One thing I know is that he hates it and feels guilty and doesn\u2019t expect me to tolerate him in a time I want to help him because I know the good person he is -when he is not mad of course-. Another thing to add is that he has told me that his bad temper has been like this ever since he was born but as he is getting older seems he is getting worse and worse. your help is seriously appreciated. How can I help him and support him?? Thanks,",

At that time i was absolutely devastated and had a really hard time. He was in a coma for about a month, however after a few successful surgeries he started waking up, and against all odds he survived. Injuries he suffered were great, but now, after 4 months, he is slowly recovering, he learned how to walk again, he recognizes his family and me, his long-term memory is more or less ok. However, his short-term memory is pretty bad, and because of the accident he cant open his eyes, and it is not sure whether he will be able to see again in his life. We are best friends from college, I live in Slovakia, he lives in Czech republic, so we were able to see each other only when in school, but we were always together, whether in school or when we were going out to bars etc. He is recovering in Czech republic, I am currently living in Slovakia, so I cannot see him that often. The problem is, i thought i got use to the fact that he is no longer going to school with me and that I am not seeing him regularly. However, he likes to talk on the phone (of course he is confused some times), and whenever his family calls me and I talk to them and to him, I start to shiver, shake, suddenly I am feeling cold and it takes my body about half an hour to relax. This is nothing serious, but I thought I am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better. But just a few days ago, when his family called me (after nearly a month or so), I immediately started to shake and experience these feelings again. I would like to know what to do, or how to get over this anxiety, i want to be helpful to my friend, and not feel this weak whenever I talk to him. Thank you",

Please don\u2019t hate me. I just turned 20 and I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Major Depression when I was 17. I was later diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Mania. I\u2019m really sad all the time. I\u2019ve taken lots of different kinds of medication but they don\u2019t work at all (except for Xanax). One of the problems I\u2019ve been having is that I don\u2019t seem to react to situations the way people around me do. I\u2019m hypersensitive about what people think about me. Sometimes I get really upset about great things. I recently met a great girl and we got along really well so I started crying and tried to kill myself. Other times, people will hurt me and do really bad things to me, and it makes me laugh. If I get too excited about something like a new job, a trip to somewhere fun or even just a really good song, it makes me want to die. But at the same time I\u2019m happy\u2026 Sometimes I think about hurting people I care about to show them how much I love them. When my friends do nice things for me, I want to stab them and hold them in my arms but I know that\u2019s not polite. I avoid certain social situations like parties because I fear my excitement may cause me to become suicidal. It\u2019s all really confusing. Is there anything I can do to be more like normal people?

I have a broken hip, my own fault, when I told her she cried and said she would come to the hospital immediately then talked only about her relationship for 45 minutes and didn\u2019t come. From then on she only visited when asked for help and only if she had another excuse to be in the area. she only called once of her own accord 3 weeks after surgery, she talked about herself the entire time, begrudgingly asked how I was, then asked if I was still using a walker to get around. I was going to work for her this summer which would have made her life a lot easier for her to see her boyfriend, when I told her that I was going to be laid up for quite a while she offered no sympathy or even acknowledgement and changed the subject back to herself and got off the phone.

        "Patient Question": "7 weeks ago my wife had a full hystorectomy done because she had really bad abdominal pains. almost 2 weeks ago (wednesday) i came home from work and she was crying and was very emotional and wouldnt stop talking about her past and her family. i expected this kind of behavior considering the surgery and comforted her. this went on for a few days. then she became fully convinced that our neighbor (her best friend) wanted her to call child protective services on her husband because of abuse. the strange thing was she never actually talked to friend about it. this idea then began taking over everything she did and she couldnt really fuction and was confused a lot of the time. we also have twin boys which are 3yrs of age and she is a stay at home mother. so finally her friend and i sat her down and had a long talk about her conserns regaurding her friend\u2019s family (sunday). everything seemed to be fine after that..for a couple days. tuesday afternoon hit and i was to be away on a trip for 10 days. i thought she was fine. she was acting like herself again. well on wednesday i got a call from my fist sergeant (i am in the air force) saying my wife was on base and asking for help because her friend\u2019s husband was trying to hurt our kids. she thought that while she and our boys were sleeping he broke into our house, physically abused my sons, then left. she was convinced that my boys have bruises on them. well, she was escorted to the ER and i called a buddy of mine to watch the boys for me untill i was able to catch the next flight back home. she has been in the hospital for 4 days and they are still trying to figure out what is wrong with her. this was out of the blue. i mean it was like a light switch that went off in her head. even when i go and visit her she is absolutely convinced that her friend\u2019s husband is trying to hurt our boys. when in fact is our boys were never hurt and he isnt an abuser. i guess my question is what can cause this. she was normal up untill that one night i came home from work. i miss my wife.",

A week later we tried to get a mortgage on a home and found out that he has something in collection. So I suggested taking line of credit out in my name to bye off the collection. So next here we could then purchase a home and get married. Aug 2 he left for a 10-week course. In the 10 weeks he would only call once a week and he allowed the truck to bounce twice (I first figure the way his pay was going in and the way the payments were going out there wasn\u2019t enough money (2 pays 3 payment in aug.) I didn\u2019t get mad I went up and deposited $1000 to cover it. Once there I found out that he didn\u2019t transfer anymore. I fly down to watch him graduate and see my friends (I was from there) and drive back with him. The trip sucked he wasn\u2019t interested in me based on his saying, attitude and he stated drinking. I tried to talk to him and I was given the cold shoulder. Home (we don\u2019t live together yet) My gut was telling me something was wrong so I decided knowing his password went on because I was concern about his drinking (recovering addict) if I could find something that would help me. Instead I found an email to the girl on course. I asked him about her and said I know because I read the email. He got mad at me saying he can\u2019t trust me and walked out the door. I want to talk find out if it do to drinking, was it an emotional or physical affair. He tells me they were set up emails, and I am a fool and break off our engagement. I told him if we are not emotional together then we will not be financially together and I made him get his parents to co-sign a loan to buy the truck from me. He says he will continue making the line of credit payments. I want to believe him but I have a feeling I will have to take him to small claims court for this.",

He\u2019s never really dealt with his emotions about his past, although he is a sensitive guy and I know he has a lot of hurt inside him. He has instead chosen to repress and ignore these emotions. He moved across country, so his family is out of sight, out of mind. He will do anything to distract himself and not think about it. He definitely has shown signs of depression on and off over the years. I\u2019ve suggested therapy to him before. It comes up perhaps once a year. He is extremely reluctant and he says has no desire to relive his terrible past. I\u2019ve told him I understand that and that I think while therapy would be painful, I believe it would be worth it in the end. He\u2019s extremely stubborn and pushing an issue will make him more likely to reject it, so I don\u2019t bring this up often. My approach is to discuss it in a supportive manner, encourage help, not push it, leave it to germinate. It seems to have made him open up to the possibility of help. He has conceded in the past year that he might be depressed. We recently visited his adoptive parents. It had been 3-4 years since he had seen them, because they live back \u201chome\u201d and he\u2019s been avoiding his past entirely. His foster father is very old and unwell. He put off seeing them as long as he could. I encouraged him to go visit, because the guilt at not going was evident and I knew he would have terrible regrets if his foster father died and he had not gone to see him in so long. I know he feels a lot of guilt for being so far from them, especially now they are old and unwell. He approached me today and stated he thinks he is depressed. I think this is a huge step for him to admit this. I want him to get the help he needs. I will of course, be supportive and will listen to anything he wants to talk about.

I began treatment with a woman and after about 6 months we entered into a personal relationship. She spent Christmas day with my family, her birthday, movies and shared her financial woes with me. Her wages were to be garnished and I worked everyday for about a week to help resolve this issue for her. I made many telephone calls and did intensive research. About six months after beginning the personal relationship she summarily dismissed me after a session by not giving me a future appointment. No explanation what so ever. I became so frustered and upset that I just left. I have tried to communicate with several times for an explanation and have not received a response. At the least to me her behavior was unethical, unprofessional and down right mean. She has no remorse regarding the pain she has caused me. I believe she has done this before and will do it again..no one should be subjected to what she did to me. She has more than enough hours, a masters and her PHD and doesn\u2019t have a license with the BBS. I am about ready to contact the director of the couseling service and filing a complaint with the BBS. Another therapist will verify my story as well as my family.",

So I\u2019m in a relationship with a girl for 3 months now we know each other for almost a year and we used to text 24/7. We love each other so much we make gifts for ourselves, we go out daily and we have the best time ever. But I don\u2019t know why I am very jealous and I can\u2019t help it. Every time she is with her friend, a guy who is very good friend of hers for 6 years, I just lose it. She is a honest person, she wouldn\u2019t ever cheat on someone, she hasn\u2019t shown even once that she can do this to me, still I\u2019m very jealous, we\u2019ve had some arguments about that and she said that if I trusted her I wouldn\u2019t worry, I do trust her really, but I don\u2019t trust the guy or I just don\u2019t feel it right to text so much with him or go out with him, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, I think he may like her even. And the problem is getting even more serious, I\u2019m starting to get jealous when she goes out with her girl friends I start to overthink what she is doing, who is she texting and I\u2019m so afraid of losing her. I have never felt another person so close to my heart as I feel her, I really don\u2019t want to lose her. I haven\u2019t told her I\u2019m jealous of her girl friends because that would be ridiculous. I really want to keep our relationship healthy, but this is slowly becoming a huge problem which I need help to remove. Sometimes I am jealous that she has fun without me, I hide those feelings from her and I hold the pain in myself. I really hope that you understand my problem even tho my English isn\u2019t that good and my problem is probably very strange. Please help me, I want to change. (age 16, from Bulgaria)",

Throughout that year i expressed that I really didnt want to go back, that i loved where i was, etc. His reply back was always that he wanted to go back to warmer weather (he hated the cold), a place where we had friends and was more affordable.

We have been together since July 2nd 2010, and it is March 28th 2011. We were friends for many years before we started dating but due to both of us moving around we were not able to have a relationship. She is everything I ever wanted in a woman and I am so happy to have her in my life. I had no sexual interactions what so ever before I was with her, she is my first in everything. Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. When she was growing up her parents neglected and even abused her. She was molested on several occasions, but never by a family member. Her life has not been one of happiness and is full of past pains that plague her to this day. She never felt loved or cared about by anyone, and sought out relationships to fill this void. Her first sexual experience was with a female, they were friends and one night during a sleep over her friend put her hand down my girlfriends pants and began feeling around down there. My girlfriend said she did it back to her friend. She was bisexual for a while and dated a few girls, but never did anything for that kiss them. Though not often she claims. Her first sexual experience with a boyfriend was when she was 14 and the guy she was dating asked her to \u201ctouch him\u201d, and so she did. She says she didn\u2019t want to but did it to make him happy. In her next relationship she let him suck on her breasts and finger her, she touched him but while he had pants on so there was no contact with his penis. In her third relationship she also let him finger her and she gave him a hand job as well. In her last relationship she went out with this guy for 2.5 years and she really loved him. He was the first she gave oral sex to, and they did everything together. He fingered her; she gave him many hand jobs and lots of oral sex. She wanted to have sex and so did he, but she brought it up to him. They agreed and she claims that he only penetrated her a little bit before finishing, so she doesn\u2019t believe she lost her virginity. He claims that every time they tried, which both him and her say was 3 times, that they had full intercourse but she swears that after that first time having failed, and the other two times they never got past being naked, none of the times they ever had full intercourse. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn\u2019t have full on sex with him. I know her was able to penetrate her at least somewhat so I also have issues with whether she was still a virgin the first time we had sex.",

        "Patient Question": "I\u2019m asking for your help and I\u2019m hopeful that you can point me in the right direction. The shape of my life is good, but there are lingering anxieties that have not resolved themselves in time. I\u2019ve had the painful experience of being the target of bullying numerous times throughout my life. I\u2019ve grown increasingly immune to bullying but unbeknownst to me a symptom has emerged. These episodes of bullying were traumatic but the most traumatic aspect was the breach of trust because the bullying came from friends and family. As such I experience social anxiety and emotionally stress. I am a heterosexual male, fairly honest, emphatic, and trustworthy but that has been put into question by bullies who attack my lack of manliness. I\u2019m actually a good looking man who attracts women but that creates jealousy and unintentionally provokes bullying. The bullies project onto me their own insecurities. These include two highly controversial sexual preferences, one more so than the other. They are: homosexuality and pedophilia. It takes a higher level of emotional maturity to recognize that homosexuality is perfectly fine but pedophilia is a sexual disorder, distinct from child molestation which is a crime. In my opinion no one wants to be sick, so on one wants to be a pedophile nor depressed nor schizophrenic nor anxious, etc. People want to happy and healthy. I cannot cure those bullies with their insecurities and I cannot cure myself. I know the truth of who I am, but I sometimes feel anxious all the same. It rattled my bones. I use to become easily unnerved whenever homosexuality was discussed positively or negatively. Not so much these days. However, being bullied and told you\u2019re a pedophile carries such a heavy social stigma that has taken longer to recover from. I should point out that I never had any issues with homosexuality and respected such preferences. I never had any issues being around children, and my brother asked me to be the godfather of his son because I was so responsible. I\u2019ve lost sight of that. It has been forgotten due to social anxiety and emotional trauma. My question is simple. Should I seek professional help to rid myself of this cognitive dissonance or will it pass with time? My problem is I have become self-absorbed because of bullying, but I really want to reconnect with others.",

        "Patient Question": "I have been in a relationship with my best friend for five years. We are a great fit in all ways, but he frequently questions my integrity and his self-worth. A few years ago, I took a high paying job as a personal assistant. We were living in a bad neighborhood and I jumped at the opportunity to make more money- without questioning the logistics. It ended up being a personal assistant to a pimp, arranging dates, managing money, and sending out ads for the girls. We talked about what my job would entail, and he was not happy with it, but agreed that we needed the money and it wouldn\u2019t be forever. A few months after I started, my boss forced me to do something not in my job description. In the situation, I feared for my life, so I obliged. I didn\u2019t show up for my shift the next day, hoping it would all just go away and I could find a different job quickly. I started receiving threatening phone calls. My boss demanded all the money he had paid me back ($20,000). He had a copy of my ID and social from the hiring process. He made it very clear that my life was in his hands. I worked as a sex worker for a year and a half to pay him back in full. During that time, my boyfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out. Our marriage plans went out the window, I was forced out of our friend group, and was left to deal with the aftermath alone. That was two years ago, and we are in a much better place now. But for him, marriage still isn\u2019t on the table and his friends haven\u2019t welcomed me back. He says that he often blames himself for not figuring it out sooner, and blames me for not coming to him for help. I try to explain to him that I was scared to involve anyone else for fear of what would happen to them, but he just doesn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t go to the cops. I\u2019m afraid this occurrence will always be a stain on my relationship resume with him, and that he will only see his pain of feeling betrayed and cheated on, when that was not my intention. Can we work towards forgiveness? Or am I wasting my time? (From the USA)",

I\u2019m now 23 and my life is beautiful. I have dealt with most of my issues. But one that won\u2019t leave me alone is that I feel I am stuck with the emotional maturity of a small child. It\u2019s like I stopped developing at some point. I cry literally every day, often at things that most people would find ridiculous. I have so many emotions and I don\u2019t know what to do with them. I am so embarrassed because I frequently find myself fighting back tears in public. I\u2019m not depressed, I am very happy in general, it\u2019s just that my emotional responses are childlike and it only takes the tiniest thing to set me off.

When I entered the fall semester of my sophomore year in college, the coursework really picked up and I saw myself doing poorly on one exam after another; it really took a toll on me and I just became more and more discouraged after each failure.

She was diagnosed in 2003 .Most of the symptoms were present throughout our married life together. She refuses to take her medication or receive any medical treatment, since her diagnoses. The last three years have been the greatest trouble for me. To be honest with you looking back on our relationship I would say the last 10 years have been a challenge. We have three children, two boys and one girl, ages 12, 10 and 5 and it has been hardest on them. In January 2006 I made the decision to leave the relationship. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.",

My grandfather was a child molester, though I don\u2019t remember him ever molesting me. I DO remember him taking pictures of me naked, but nothing else. It didn\u2019t seem to be very traumatic at all though. However I still have a sexual desire for boys around the age of 12 or 13 or so. A therapist I talked to (it wasn\u2019t a full blown weekly thing,..I just talked to her three times, and that was it.) said that something happened at that age that stunted my sexual development, and now I am stuck at that age sexually. I agree with her conclusion because it would explain all my feelings such as my feeling that my body hair is unnatural and that it makes me feel dirty, and that people the same age as my body are intimidating to make friends with. 13 yr olds are much easier to make friends with for me as well. I have no idea what it was. Luckily I also have another paraphilia, which is called partialism (fetishism).",

        "Patient Question": "Your opinion? My partner is contradictory and critical, but at the same time gets very upset if any of her ideas or decisions are questioned in any way. Examples: She will ridicule any book I am reading unless it is one recommended by her. If it is not a subject that interests her, especially technical books, she will describe the book as childish rubbish. The same with any TV program or film. She is an aspirational vegetarian. If I have meat and she has vegetarian she has spent the evening \u2014 while I am eating \u2014 asking how I could eat dead rotting flesh, how do I feel having caused the death of\u00a0 a living being just for my gratification etc. The following week she will buy, cook and eat chicken and say how tasty it is. Sex. This has now ceased. Very often she has not only rejected me, but says that I am disgusting for wanting sex, \u201cDon\u2019t come near me. Don\u2019t you dare touch me\u201detc \u2014 almost hysterical. A couple of days later she will start crying and ask why don\u2019t I make love to her any more, don\u2019t I care for her? She will deny that she ever said that she did not want me near her. I thought that being nice to her would gain her trust and we would get closer. But it seems to have the opposite reaction. The nicer I am, the more awkward, contradictory and demanding she becomes. She seems to need to push me until we have a disagreement. My partner\u2019s mother was English and her father Portuguese and she was brought up in Portugal. Her parents broke up when she was 10 and she ended up with her mother who did not spend much time with her as she had to work hard. With her job her mother was given a scholarship for her daughter to go to the local international school. My partner spent years there but never got on as her first language was not English. She felt very left out, not coming from a rich family. My partner has two older brothers and mentions her poor relationship with them when she was a child. They continually told her she was stupid and ugly. If she wore a new dress they would tease her mercilessly. I think this has had a big impact. (age 65, from United Kingdom)",

His behavior include emotional manipulation, intense reactions, exaggerations, and he has paranoia to a certain extent.He keeps calling my mother daily to see where she is, and secretly follows her to work most mornings. He demanded for all her passwords for social media, as well as her phone.When she comes home late from work, even for 5 minutes, he creates a scene and argues with her. He threatens that he will kill himself. When they argue, if to him it feels like the problem wont be resolved, to make amends, he threatens her. He threatens her with not drinking or eating, constantly drinks alcohol with his medication. He is also delusional in the fact that my mother is cheating on him, when this is not the case. He took extreme measures to grab her cell phone, download apps that can see all the text messages sent and received, and he also has a GPS on her constantly tracking her. At the same time, he sits in his office after work most of the day and listens to 5 hour voice recordings of some type of listening device he has in her work office, or here at home. It might even be somehow installed on her phone, he is constantly trying to find out a possible cheating going on, or even trying to look for lies in the voice recordings. In an altercation, he slept in the car for many days, tried to drive while he was drunk at the same time telling me that the medication he is taking has severe interactions with alcohol, and that he can die any second, even wrote a will.The next mornings he wakes up like nothing happened, acts like nothing happened, and continues to repeat the same things over and over. His facial expression looks extremely different, as if he is psychologically disturbed. He refuses to see a psychologist because he sees it as a way to throw money in the trash.He says things like, You are a ll smart, but Im the only one crazy. How can I help him?",

When we were young she was mentally and physically abusive to me, insulting me if I came near, and hitting or pushing me down if I was within reach. Our parents tried to address this themselves, but finally just told me I couldn\u2019t change her and to stay away from her. My sister has stated that her hatred started the night I was born because she had to quit watching TV to go to the hospital, and that afterwards she was forced to share my parents attention with me. She rationalizes that it is perfectly normal for siblings to hate each other.",

She will make a fuss out of something, call her mother and trigger her off (Eg; During my wedding reception, my parents got carried away greeting guests. My wife blamed my parents for \u2018not offering her water on purpose\u2019 \u2013 she did not even ask for it. She triggered her mother. Her mother asked me to \u2018offer water to a thirsty woman even if I am not willing to feed my wife\u2019. Both women soon got enraged.) 4.

Later, she absolutely denies all she said in her anger and swears on gods that she never lies \u2013 I am the liar. 4. Every time we try to speak about these issues, she \u2018faints\u2019. My wife says there is \u2018no oxygen flowing to her brain\u2019 and asks her father to violently shake her head while blaming me for what happened to her mother. She \u2018regains consciousness\u2019 after a few minutes. Opportunity to address problems lost. 5. Recently, she began exhibiting literal split personality. She went into a trance \u2013 some \u2018god\u2019 had entered her. She said my birth was flawed and that god has come here to save me, threatened my parents with curses and death and asked me to treat my wife well. She physically hits my wife when angry. 6. My wife is very similar \u2013 dual behavior \u2013 shows affection, romance, we live normally for a few days and then finds a random fault with a sudden mood swing and goes into a rage-crying-despair cycle. In her rage mode she is absolutely uncontrollable. She hits me physically, abuses me verbally, weeps and threatens to call the cops and book me for \u2018dowry harassment\u2019, degrades me in front of her mother, plays the victim and so on. 7.

He is not fully aware of her issues, but is aware of her pathological lying.He is very intelligent in \u201cbook-related\u201d things, such as reading and mathematics. Other than that, he is below par. He shows little to no respect for the rights of others.

He has stolen and \u201ccoveted\u201d things that do not belong to him. He lies so much, I assume everything he says is untrue.

After the tooth brushing bed time routine he will continue asking for something to eat (even though he had a snack before brushing) untill his dad gives in or he is carried, crying and faking injuries to his bed. He seems to not understand at all that the rules also apply to him, \u201cbecause he gets good grades in school\u201d.

Unfortunately for many years now this is not the case. I tend to believe that this was due to a very hard break up that I had when I was around 21. From discussions I had with a therapist she insists that this cannot be the case and that the cause should be in earlier years in life (when I was a child).

Last semester, I was having a hard time dealing with stress and loneliness and my own behavior started to scare me. Whenever I was alone \u2013which was the case very often- I would keep talking to myself or singing. When I forced myself to stop, it just went on in my head and got really tiring. So I decided to go to the psychological consultation offered at my university. The first appointment was very helpful because I really needed someone to tell me whether I was going crazy. The psychologist told me it was my choice whether I wanted to come again or not, and we set an appointment for a month later. Back then, I thought it was a good idea to give myself the feeling that I was seeking help and also to feel a bit encouraged/\u201cpressured\u201d to follow his advice before the next time. Since I was no longer in that hysterical state, the second session felt a bit unnecessary. I don\u2019t like it when I keep complaining to others (although very often I feel that I need to do so) and of course I admitted that I was feeling a lot better. Nonetheless, I agreed to have a third session another 2 months later, so that I wouldn\u2019t be \u201call on my own\u201d from then on. However, the thought keeps bothering me that I am just seeking attention. In fact, it makes me feel super-attention-seeking, just writing that. I used to be a good student at school, and now this kind of recognition is missing at the university. I keep involving myself in voluntary work, but the only reason it makes me happy is that it gives me acknowledgement from others.

        "Patient Question": "Hello, I apologize if this appears jumbled, I feel there\u2019s a lot I need to add! I would like to know whether these symptoms may be pointing towards Bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety about 6 years ago. Since then, I\u2019ve gotten married, moved cities and went to university. I\u2019ve also had periods of depression, and auditory hallucinations. During the past three years (noticed it more recently) I\u2019ve been irritable, feeling high and low. Irritable, in the sense that I lash out at my husband for no reason. I just suddenly get angry \u2014 when he hasn\u2019t done anything- and start shouting. After, I feel an immense sense of guilt and I will often break down in tears. Other times, I have these sorts of daydreams \u2014 but they feel more real than daydreams, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is I\u2019ll get an idea in my head and I\u2019ll get lost in it \u2014 it can range from anything, a recent example was the idea of being in a famous band. In reality, I couldn\u2019t do such a thing due to being so timid. In this sense I also overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because. When it doesn\u2019t happen the way I imagined, I\u2019ll become depressed and feel generally hopeless, useless. If it is of any use, my grandmother had Bipolar. I apologize if this was muddled, but I\u2019m not sure whether I should refer to a doctor or not, or if what I am experiencing is related to Bipolar at all. Thank you for your time!

I was only sober 2 months before I fell into a drug that helps me even know I know its not truly helping. Dxm is the drug. I take it because I can lucid dream memories that I enjoy. Like memories of me and my ex and times in the phsyc hospital I was in three times because I felt safe there. I take it daily so I can see her face(even while we were together cause we just started to fall atpart the last 3or4 months.), be safe in the hospital environment, and fix things iv screwed up in the past. The bad thing is it makes my psychosis worse. Iv already attempted suicid twice, but the first time my friend stopped me before I took all the pills and the second time my ex from above called me as I had the gun in my mouth, and I felt it was a sign that I had to stay alive for her.

They come on suddenly and with absolutely no triggers whatsoever, although for hours to days before they happen I\u2019ll sometimes have uncomfortably high levels of energy\u2013I\u2019ll feel either obnoxious and silly (but in a kind of desperate way, if that makes sense) or I\u2019ll be really productive and jittery. Both of these high energy feelings are unsettling, maybe because I normally almost never have high levels of energy. The \u201cspells,\u201d \u201cepisodes,\u201d whatever they are, involve extreme guilt and disgust with myself\u2013but it\u2019s a very visceral feeling and it\u2019s overwhelming. I feel trapped inside my disgusting self and like I\u2019m willing to do anything to escape it. I feel incredibly agitated and yet trapped at the same time\u2013like I want to move or do something but I can\u2019t. I also just feel extremely empty and sad\u2013like, I\u2019m filled with this overwhelming emotion but other than that I\u2019m hollow. I feel so desperate and so unhappy and sick and like I hate myself so much\u2013but it\u2019s such a powerful physical feeling that it\u2019s hard to describe with words because it\u2019s a feeling and not a thought. I sob uncontrollably during these episodes (they usually last a few hours although they occasionally last longer) I\u2019ve definitely been suicidal during these periods, but it\u2019s not so much a conscious desire to kill myself than it is a need to escape how I\u2019m feeling.

However, when I was younger, I developed an intense paranoia of schizophrenia. I didn\u2019t know that I had OCD until I was 19, so the whole time I thought that my weird thoughts were simply representative of a future schizophrenic outbreak. In high school I was a very paranoid person and I was always consumed by a pervasive fear that I was going crazy. This fear led me to pay an obsessive amount of attention to my weird thoughts, which led to further analysis of how I truly believed that I was going crazy.

This is also the same mom that has told her daughter \u201cI\u2019m not going to quit smoking and drinking until I want to\u201d after her daughter cried begging for her to stop atleast one.

It\u2019s also hard to believe that she cares because she is not reliable at all. She doesn\u2019t respect my time. For example with rides. Yes, she doesn\u2019t have to give me a ride at all if she doesn\u2019t want to but she needs to tell me that so I can plan another ride instead of having me be TWO hours late.

I have been having increasingly problematic anxiety attacks for the last 8 weeks. My boyfriend has been incredibly patient but it is running thin.

I have huge panic attacks that cause not only my boyfriend to fear me but my past comes back every time to tell me that I\u2019m not worth it, etc. (I was abandoned as a child and adopted at age 12, with significant abuse before and after adoption).

He usually sat in the same seat but the day of the accident he switched seats with his brother. he blames himself because his dad blamed him before he passed away of cancer in prison for drug distribution. I\u2019m kind of scared of him sometimes. I cut my hand on accident once cooking and his eyes when he seen the blood, he was like a completely different person. like he had no soul for a minute until he calmed down. he feels like killing people\u00a0when they annoy him. and I\u2019m always cautious around him now.

Initially, I hated him because he seemed to act somewhat pompous. But at the beginning of my sophomore year, we began to develop a relationship. Initially, we were just friends and I never really felt any kind of intimate feelings for him. As with any other attractive guy I\u2019ve met, however, I was somewhat shy around him at first but started to feel more comfortable as I got to know him better. But still, we were strictly friends. It wasn\u2019t until the summer between my sophomore and junior year that I realized that I had feelings for him. We spent a lot of time together, as we were both taking the same summer school class. During this summer, I found out a lot about him. I noticed that he didn\u2019t speak about his dad a lot, if at all, and he liked to garden, cook, and was very meticulous about how he looked. I attributed these qualities to the possibility that he was a very proper gentleman, as he surprisingly turned out to be due to the fact that I used to hate him. One of my good female friends met him and immediately told me that he was gay. I disagreed with her. I had remembered him telling me about a girl he dated back in high school, so I assumed him to be straight. But then he had also mentioned that the reason why they broke up was because he told her that they got along better as friends. I\u2019ve heard this excuse from other guys, so it didn\u2019t hint to me that he was gay. During my junior year, he told my aforementioned female friend that he was gay, and she relayed the information to me. My first reaction was denial. I think that I had so severly developed feelings for him, almost on an unconscious level, that I couldn\u2019t bear to believe that he was gay. Later that week though, he told me face-to-face. After that, our friendship didn\u2019t fall apart and I wasn\u2019t distressed. In fact, our friendship strengthened and for a while things were great. I have told him several times that I have feelings for him, and he just laughs it off. I\u2019m not sure if he realizes that I\u2019m serious.",

I\u2019ve never felt like hurting someone in real life but I love seeing characters suffer in their respective universes. I have been thinking about how this happened, and it made me think about a time 3-4 years ago when the ISIS beheading video came out.

Christmas marked the beginning of this debacle. which set up the disaster and now my BPD, etc is a Category 5 Tropical Storm. A CONTINENTAL DIVIDE now exists between my son and I has turned awakening my abandonment fears. His response is total silence (he refuses to investigate this new BPD thing) and has cut off any possibility to try to resolve this. Meanwhile ironically enough his abandonment of me over this is not imaginary. Left to my own devices I spend all my days since 1st of the year existing in a pattern of emotional turmoil I can\u2019t take much longer. I alternate between feelings of inconsolable grief and abandonment into resentment and culminating in my anger exploding leaving horrible messages on his phone which increases the gap. If we had talked when this all began it would have never developed into the mega storm it is but now it has \u2013 he has made no effort to get insight into BPD \u2013 he has genuinely abandoned me. The anger eventually burns out leaving me numb then we start over again. Being ignored as though I don\u2019t exist also fuels the flames. Suffice it to say that I don\u2019t see a way out and I do not want to spend my life cycling between all these painful feelings. I want to be able to talk to him, acknowledge how a part of me knows the rage is wrong and help him understand the mechanics of BPD. But I cannot make him talk to me so he is never going to understand and I am doomed forever to the abandonment I feel. While he was supportive during 2 medial emergencies I experienced now I have to guess that because this alleged malady of mine is emotional he views it something i made up to to manipulate him. He\u2019s withdrawn totally which only multiplies my feelings. Suddenly out ofere he\u2019s gone. HOW DO I SURVIVE this? My warm/caring son is as cold as ice. He has no interest in what BPD is.

He is an honest, good man who has deep fears and avoids intimacy. He doesn\u2019t know what to do when I cry and never talks about his feelings. Our \u201crelationship\u201d has been quite unusual. We never interacted with friends and family, never dated. We were basically friends with benefits who also shared deep and casual discussions with daily interaction.

I know he is confused and I\u2019m giving him space but I\u2019m so tired of the confusion. I have tried to move on as well, but no matter what happens, I long for our connection.

        "Patient Question": "My mother has lived with me for years since she is regularly unemployed. Whenever I moved during the last 16 years, she usually followed. In the last 4 years, she has become paranoid\u2013someone is stealing electricity, wifi, cable, cell phone service, water. We didn\u2019t even have wifi or cable at the time. I even checked the water and electric usage, but found they were consistent with usage at other addresses. Then she decided someone must be at home at all times because someone is sneaking into the apartment\u2013to mistreat our pets, to fiddle with the electricity, to steal services, to live in the attic. She also claims someone had wired the apartment to listen to us, wired the front door so it would randomly open, stole our forks (I don\u2019t know where they went), stole the Mummy dvd (we have at least 100 dvds, but that one was the only one taken, sneaks through the ventilation, stops by and electrocutes her around 3 a.m. on random mornings, and added wires under the driver side of my car (don\u2019t worry she pulled out). Someone disrupts the signal on her analog radio, she insists all power, circuit breakers be off, and the major appliances unplugged except for the refrigerator and a few lamps. She says her last 5 cell phones were hacked and taken over by someone. I have never experienced or witnessed any of the problems she claims. So she accuses me of helping the someone because I say none of these issues can be proven. She won\u2019t see a doctor, and she can pass any mental test. Honestly, I wander if she is a dick rather than sick. These incidents have been continual at 3 dif ferent addresses. In the one address, the landlord said she could not live there any more because she was entering the basement and changing the handyman\u2019s repairs. (I don\u2019t know if this accusation is true; she denies it.) At one point nearly 2 years ago, I expressly asked her not to destroy the landlord\u2019s county letter because it itemized repairs to the house. She ignored my request and ripped up the documents. I gave her $4000 (my savings) and my car and kicked her out of my apartment two years ago, so she stayed with my aunt for a week, in hotels for about a month. Then she came back for another $2000 (payday loans). Eventually, she spoke with the VA hospital, received a bed at a homeless shelter, and money to return to school. They also offered to pay for housing, but she couldn\u2019t find a place she was comfortable with for the money offered. After a few months in the shelter, she \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d make it to the shelter by curfew, so she was kicked out and moved in with me again. Within a year, we moved again. About 8 months ago, we were evicted from a house (only 5 months into a year lease) because \u201csomeone\u201d had cut out all the copper connecter in the electrical outlets (a fire hazard), had cut a large outdoor cord connecting the central air to the house, and had removed insulation and created holes in the outer walls. I cannot prove it was my mom, but no one else was in the house. She or I am always home. Now we\u2019re in an apartment and she opens the outlets and has cut the connectors to the phone jacks. She still experiences are all of the aforementioned issues. I discovered she had pulled wires beneath the driver\u2019s seat of my 8 month old car. She claims someone is hacking into its system. I plan to move because of unrelated issues, but because of my mom, I am hesitating. I am sick of the problems. I am sick of her refusing to listen to reason. I told her 5 months ago that I wanted to go separate ways with this move. I tried to give her time to find an apartment, get a job, request government assistance (she hasn\u2019t worked since 2010), but she has proven she unwilling to take care of herself. She wants me to buy her a Winnebago, so she can live in the woods with her dog and cat. I am tempted because I don\u2019t want to continue this cycle anymore. I don\u2019t want her to live with me. I don\u2019t even want her to know where I live. I don\u2019t even feel guilty about it any more because every time I find something she \u201cfixed\u201d I just cry. However, I feel bad for the dog and cat since I\u2019ve had them for years. I feel guilty because there are no other siblings or family\u2026 just me. This situation feels like the rest of my life.

But recently his mom told him he has to be home before 9pm. Also he can\u2019t come over during the weekdays anymore unless he texts her and asks. He is 25 years old. She always is telling him he is making mistakes by not being home and not inviting her to the movies with us. His little sister acts like she is his other mom, and she can tell him what to do, because his mom gave her that power. We have talked about moving in together, but now his mom isn\u2019t going to let us. He pays her rent every month ($400). He is the oldest child as well. My boyfriend is seeing the way his mom is, and wants to talk to her. But she always makes his sisters sit in so they can gang up on him. His dad loves me and always is very welcoming in his house. He always tells us that he is just so happy and proud of how we are trying to be on our own. I just want to know.. is his mom taking this to far? Does she not want us together? She does she just not like me?",

I seem to be clinically depressed, suffering from severe bouts of depression all my life on and off. Sometimes, my libido will increase out of the blue, and I\u2019ll have this sporadic desire to sleep with many people, but I do not act on it. I also can become extremely moody, sometimes I\u2019m happy for a few hours, but succumb to the bleak side of sadness and disappointment. I can also become angry for no reason, irritable, agitated, restless, and anxious all at once. I also seem to have racing rapid thoughts that are very difficult to control or tune out. Angry outburts are normal when I feel agitated, panicky, with rapid racing thoughts. My mood swings also heighten during my PMS. Sometimes I feel very creative, but that is rare, since I\u2019m mostly severely depressed. Sometimes I will read for hours and hours, like its the end of the world. Sometimes, my skin feels like its crawling all over my body. Perhaps these symptoms are more align with hyperthyroidism, but I\u2019m not exactly certain.",

He speaks out of turn, has said mean things, and doesn\u2019t really seem to care about authority or following the rules. (all of this is sometimes) Sometimes, he\u2019s great. He tends to NOT be helpful or kind and is causing himself many issues. He\u2019s had several school detentions for doing things such as name-calling or being disrespectful to his teachers. He is involved in scouting and loves it, but won\u2019t listen to adult leaders or scout leaders. He\u2019s had privileges taken away, and will now need to have his scouting experiences limited as he is not reliable in that setting. He doesn\u2019t want his behaviors restricted but I can\u2019t have him acting out everywhere. He is developing a reputation as kind of a jerk. His dad and I have divorced 5 years ago and he sees us both regularly and he also has a stepdad in his life that he cares about. All the parents are engaged to assist him in getting what he needs. I have a flexible work arrangement and am able to be home most days right after school gets out. I help with homework, we eat meals together\u2013I\u2019ve made a point to tell him in no uncertain terms that my love for him is unconditional. My other kid exhibits none of these behaviors. I\u2019m at a loss. The school principal has assured me that while my kid is on the \u201cwatch list\u201d at school he\u2019s by no means the worst offender. He wandered off at a recent scout outing doing something that could have endangered himself and there will be consequences for that. So far, being grounded, having detentions, etc don\u2019t really seem to matter to him. He gets really wound up and doesn\u2019t listen and it feels like attention seeking behavior. We\u2019ve also recently done Neurotherapy (biofeedback) for him which seemed to make a positive difference\u2013but he\u2019s now continuing with the bad behaviors. Looking for a suggestion, a book, a counselor in some sort of modality I should look for. Thanks much (From the USA)",

When I was younger I used to get flashbacks of sexual things I was involved in that included another young girl that was around the same age as me. The reason I have avoided talking about it is that it involves homosexuality and I don\u2019t/didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking about it to my family. In one of my flashbacks, I remember getting caught but now whenever the person that participated in the sexual acts gets mentioned, the activities in my flashbacks never get mentioned. I don\u2019t know whether they don\u2019t want to say or that it never happened and it\u2019s just my mind making it up. Growing up, I began to settle with the thought that I was making it up in my head but then around 13/14 I began to remember specifics like how the other person said things like you were born a boy, your just born in the wrong body\u2019 or incidents I woke up in a bed with a naked man. At this time I began questioning if the person I thought I was doing these things with wasn\u2019t even a little girl but an adult man.

I vividly imagine myself or a third person being slowly killed by torture and can\u2019t stop these thoughts. Since these fantasies involve very gory details, I am ashamed of them and don\u2019t have the courage to describe them to anyone because I am afraid what people might think of me. The thoughts come by themselves in waves about twice a month and each wave lasts for about 3-5 days. During these days they slightly interfere with my normal social function as I experience typical sickness behavior (lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, reduction in grooming, hard to concentrate). Even if I try to concentrate on a task I feel like I can\u2019t control my mind or how I generally feel during that time. I thought for a long time that I am the only person in the world having thoughts like that and there is no help for me but recently I thought I might try to search for answers. However, I could not find any information about this phenomenon. Can you please help me women tell me if there is any literature about this that could help me understand what is going on? Is there a type of therapy that specializes in these issues? What could I do to improve my condition?",

This line of argument made me hesitate to tell them regarding my dreams and now it has become almost impossible to talk to them. I fight constantly fight with my parents, especially mother because I don\u2019t feel consensual sex is a wrong thing.\u00a0 On top of all this, I\u2019m having trouble in my relationship.\u00a0 My partner suffers from depression and me saying no to sex is affecting us badly.\u00a0 I find sex to be a chore.

        "Patient Question": "Hi there, I\u2019m torn between accepting or rejecting a diagnosis of Bipolar II. A clinical psychologist diagnosed me with Bipolar II a week ago and now I am under a primary care physician to receive mood stabilizing medication this week. I don\u2019t think I have bipolar disorder though. Can personality not sometimes resemble bipolar? I am sometimes hyperactive and able to take on a 100 projects, feel super smart and pretty and am at the top of my game. I need little sleep and in fact find sleep an annoying timewaster. Then I have times, probably more often, where I feel sorry for myself, feel ugly, stupid and can barely clean my flat or look after my pets. When I\u2019m hyper, I harm no one, I don\u2019t spend too much or gamble or drink or do anything that could be considered damaging. I just work really hard, accomplish a lot (I work fulltime as a project manager, am a freelance educational writer and am in the third year of a science degree for which I have had 18 distinctions so far). When I am down, I do feel very sad and think of killing myself every now and then, but I would never kill myself as I know logically this would be stupid and that I always feel better again. In my mind, I am just a highly functional individual who is able to achieve a lot, use my time to the max, sometimes feeling on the top of the world and sometimes not. I\u2019m used to feeling like this and I have all sorts of coping mechanisms around it. I am completely alone, no family and few uninvolved friends, so my state of mood never affects anyone. I also have no support structure should it really be bipolar and should I need help. I don\u2019t understand why I should go on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. I\u2019ve had no breaks with reality, just a few very minor private breakdowns where I have cried a lot. But I got over those and I was just overworked and under a lot of pressure and it didn\u2019t affect anyone other than me. What do you do when you are torn between accepting a diagnosis and thinking it is total nonsense? I change my mind at least 20 times a day. I can\u2019t imagine I will be able to be compliant with taking medication or accepting help. (age 38, from South Africa)",

I disagree and of course I get upset with him if he says harsh things about them which then he counters that I am not loyal to him and I should just accept his brash, rude remarks (because he\u2019s right?). For example he says all my friends are stupid, and they are going nowhere. Most of my friends are actors and like me we are figuring it out, the business is not easy. I tell him if that if he respected me he would not talk about the people I care about that way- which then he counters that I\u2019m more emotionally invested in them. Furthermore we\u2019ve fought about me having gay guy friends, he says its not because they are gay but because they don\u2019t stand for what we are trying to build together. He then just recently said it\u2019s because they are male and I shouldn\u2019t have any male friends, that he should be the only man in my life.

I have had a severe form of social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I am terrified of people talking to me or having to talk to people and it\u2019s a huge issue when it comes to my job.

I didn\u2019t think much of it until he gave her a ride home and let her stay at his house while she was locked out of hers. I know he wasn\u2019t cheating because his mom and sister were in the kitchen with them, but this was the first time he didn\u2019t let me know what was going on. I later found out that for a little over a week he had been saying he was \u201cgoing to sleep\u201d and would hang up only to go FaceTime this girl and talk to her for hours after 11pm. He wasn\u2019t even honest with everything at first until I questioned why he had deleted their conversation from his phone and I saw the facetimes in his call log. It took him about an hour to finally tell me everything that happened, I was considering breaking up since I had felt so betrayed. He knew he was supposed to be honest and never lie again, but he did it again about two weeks ago. He told me he was texting a friend of mine about their common interest in music and I was okay and happy he was honest. I hung up with him around 2am and told him to sleep soon because we had a date planned for early the next morning. I hung out with that friend a couple days later and she told me that they had stayed up until 4am texting and that he told her not to tell me. I confronted him, he admitted and said he was planning on telling me that night. He had once again deleted their conversation and I had to get it from her, btw she didn\u2019t send me the important parts so I am no longer friends with her. And once again he has lied, again nothing huge, but he said he would send me pics of his food while on vaca. He has been gone a week and nothing, I keep pestering him for them and he said he sent one of his dessert. I knew something was shady so I confronted him and told him not to lie, but he proceeded to and was going to fake the whole thing FOR A PICTURE.

I have seen numerous posts on reddit that detail early signs and symptoms of psychopathy and I\u2019m just a bit concerned. I do by no means believe I am a psychopath but I am aware that I may be a bit more prone to mental illness (My granddad and Aunt were Manic Depressive). I know I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online but I\u2019m curious to hear your opinions on the matter. What it boils down to are my actions as a child. It began even before my stepfather (who played a huge role in my teenage turmoil) came in to my life. I have a memory (it grows weaker by the day) of being around 4-5 years old and sadistically chasing my mums canaries around a room with a hammer. Although I don\u2019t remember killing them I do remember running around the room with the hammer and also when my mum asked me what happened to them. I asked her about this recently and she said she cant remember anything. The next instance was when I was 9 years old. My Stepfather had a baby boy with my mum. There were multiple occasion where I would twist his arm to make him cry, the crying would irritate me and I would twist it more because of this. Unfortunately I broke his arm one time (This my parents found out about of course). I don\u2019t want any judgement on this please. The baby was only maybe 8 months old and of course I am disgusted by what I did but I\u2019m looking for insight not j udgement. The last sadistic behavior I remember was at about 10-11 years old. One of my cats gave birth to 4 kittens and I am pretty sure I caused the death of all four. I would be in the room on my own and I would press down on their stomachs to make them squeal. Although they never died on the spot they passed away pretty quickly and I am sure I caused some major internal injuries. I remember some of the moments very clearly but what I remember mostly was the guilt. In particular when my brother would scream in pain I would have the feeling wash over me instantly and I would keep doing it for some reason. It was the same feeling I got from telling him that his mam and dad weren\u2019t ever coming back (Parents gone in to the shop, me and brother in the car) I will finish up by saving that I consider my self a normal young adult right now. I have some issues with anxiety but I put that down to smoking grass. But I\u2019m just wondering if this behavior as a child could manifest itself again in my later years when my mental health starts to deteriorate. P.S I have a great relationship now with my family and stepfather who actually provided my mum with two more kids after this. They mean the world to me so I\u2019m curious as to where this behavior stemmed.",

I take a lot of trips, and she stated, I have clients who are always taking trips and do not pay their bill. I told her, I pay my bill. Then she said, if I dont increase your fee then I am enabling you.? And that I need to decide what is more important, therapy or trips. She also stated that she feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me, and that she needs time off. I always believed that therapist were healthy with appropriate coping skills. She seems to blame me for things, and when I bring something up, she denies it. I feel like she has been fake, and is suddently resenting me. I would have appreciated her being honest with me. All I said to her was, if she increases my rate then I will come every other week instead of weekly. And I told her that I felt like I was too dependent on her. I feel connected to her because I have shared soo much about myself to her, but I\u2019m not sure I want to continue therapy with her. I originally went to her for substance abuse and it has been a long road to recovery. She probably feels discouraged. I tend to be brutally honest and perhaps that made her mad at me?

I have tried to gently (and not so gently) remind her that we are now adults and do not need this type of guidance any longer, but she insists that it is a mothers job to teach her children all through life. She respects NO boundaries!I could write for days on that subject alone. She continually says things like the mother is the most important person in one\u2019s life, etc\u2026etc\u2026 I know her issues stem from having been sent away for her safety during a war, in her very young years, and then being reunited with her family several years later (resulting in two separation/abandonment scenarios). She also married and left her family behind to come to the US from her homeland when she was 26. This left her with no family support, except for her in-laws, which she claims treated her poorly.

I\u2019ve never been happier in my entire life. I was getting 6 hours of sleep basically every night by staying up and messaging or video calling him since he lives across the country. I was constantly nervous, but in a good way, too nervous to eat even. Even though mentally it was probably all not good for me, it was the most amazing thing ever, and I liked him so much. But then a little less than two months later, I woke up one morning feeling no attraction nor spark towards him whatsoever, almost as if the past two months of being insanely infatuated with him never existed. This was the day that spring quarter had started, and I was very stressed about my new classes, thinking there was no way I could them even. But then 5ish days later, I felt attracted towards him again, even though the spark wasn\u2019t there anymore. But then 5ish days later, the loving and attracted feeling was gone again, and I disliked even looking at pictures of him. Ever since then (it\u2019s been 10 months at the time I write this) I\u2019ve had the same cycle of my amount of attraction changing towards him. So basically every week it changes from me feeling very attracted to him, to me not being attracted to him at all. I cant even look at him when I feel unattracted to him. This is just a summary, there are many more details. But this has been hurting me so much, as well as him. I just want my feelings to go back to how they were before my feelings started to change every several days. Like I can literally feel when my feelings start to come or go.

I thought that with the constant bickering that I just lost interest, but I think its deeper than that. I don\u2019t hate her, after yesterday and I sat and thought about her crying I just felt bad. She\u2019s not an angel either, but I do realize that I tend to be a little cold to her. We\u2019ve had so much fighting in the past that everything thing she does or says to me, I take as an attack and its not necessarily so. Somedays I want to be with her, some days I want her out of my life. I\u2019ve never been professionally diagnosed with depression, but I think with me being in the Navy and always gone; I tend to take it out her whether she deserves it or not. Please help, I want to be better for our kids, but can you help identify what it is about her that just grinds my gears? or is it just me being plain old mean me?",

Empathy is difficult for me, I find that I have to force emotions out of myself to at least appear sane to others.",

As a child, of course, I had crushes on straight celebrities, but as I\u2019ve gotten older and have begun actually trying to have relationships with others, I cannot seem to stay attracted to straight men. Being physically attracted to heterosexuals is one thing, but after I get to know them, I am turned off. This has happened more times than I can count. I love gay men. Even if they\u2019re not flamboyant, there\u2019s something about a homosexual man that I am so attracted to.",
