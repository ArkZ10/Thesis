        "Patient Question": "My Dad and I usually get on quite well. We have a lot in common, but whenever he cooks or cleans he doesn\u2019t do the job properly. For instance, he won\u2019t wash his hands before cooking or clean the sides down properly. I\u2019m generally not that bothered by germs but everyone knows the basics of hygiene in the kitchen. I try to tell him that he should wash his hands, but he just get annoyed, and makes some excuse like he\u2019s \u2018thinking about other things\u2019. 9 times out of 10 he doesn\u2019t do the washing up properly either eg. there will still be oil on the frying pan. So when I try to do it or I tell him that it\u2019s unclean he just gets irritated and says \u201cyour being rather annoying now\u201d when I\u2019m just trying to makes sure my sister and I get a healthy meal in a clean kitchen. My mum usually makes sure that the kitchen and everything else is clean but she\u2019s away seeing her parents because my grandma\u2019s going into surgery soon. Now my dad\u2019s left with us he just seems incapable of doing even basic chores. I can\u2019t keep pestering him but he doesn\u2019t learn. It could be that he listens to my mum or that she does it usually and dad hasn\u2019t had to do the washing up more than once every few days. I think it\u2019s a bit of both.",

I\u2019ve no real reason to be, I\u2019m a full time student with a good part time job, a loving boyfriend, a great family and have been getting good marks at university. However, lately I\u2019ve been feeling really lost. I\u2019ve been having mood swings- I often find I\u2019m either on a really high or low, usually low mood, and that this changes quickly. I\u2019ve also been feeling very irritable, and have found myself snapping at my family for no apparent reason. I\u2019ve been on the contraceptive pill since October, and I was wondering if this could be some kind of hormone excess? I\u2019m really not sure. I\u2019m also crying frequently and feel like I\u2019ve got no real passion or talent for any of the things I used to be interested in. At times I really do feel like I\u2019m going crazy and I also feel that I can\u2019t really talk to anyone about this because they\u2019ll either think I\u2019m being attention seeking or overly dramatic, however I don\u2019t think either of these things are true and I do generally feel like I\u2019m totally lost with finding a solution to this problem.

I\u2019ve never really been big on sex(I\u2019d go as far as saying I don\u2019t much like it.) and just recently left an abusive relationship. I\u2019ve always had love for my therapist since I meet her. We clicked immediately and I\u2019ve always found her to be an attractive woman but you know laws are laws. And overtime my feelings have grown. Anyways for awhile I\u2019ve fantasize about a sexual encounter with her but in my fantasy she\u2019s always resisted me. I would push up on her and hold her against the wall kiss her etc but stop short of touching her down below because she\u2019d resist me. Recently the fantasy has changed and instead of resisting she flipped me and it became this whole hot and heavy wet sexual scene and I couldn\u2019t escape the need to touch myself. To which I had the most amazing O. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I love my therapist deeply and I like the idea of having these fantasies of her knowing I can\u2019t act on them in real life. In a weird way I feel like I\u2019m in a healthy relationship with her though I know that\u2019s not really the case. I feel awkward about living this false relationships in my head but at the same time I love/loved touching myself to the thought of her touching me/us touching each other. And now I don\u2019t want to stop having the fantasy\u2019s. When I did this today I imagined she was somewhere at work in a meeting secretly aroused with unclear meaning. Almost as if I was connected with her on a spiritual level. Anyways I know this probably sounds crazy and I talk to her about everything. Except this. Is this weird, that for now I want to keep this the way it is? And kinda of secretly and slightly irrationally I\u2019m dating her in my head. & I sounds crazy\u2026 I feel crazy for wanting to live this out in my head but I equally feel like it\u2019s a better rebound then another fucked up relationship. While I\u2019m grieving the end of a 12year relationship. I\u2019m not sure what to do with these feelings. I know I love my therapist in a very complexed way.

My respect for her has dropped drastically since I discovered her affair with my sister\u2019s sports coach. Through messages, they send nude images and sext constantly, to the point where she refuses to go anywhere without her phone because she fears someone will catch her, or because their affair has completely taken all her interest. I was sitting on the couch a couple months ago, with my phone beside me, coincidentally beside my mothers. It buzzed, and believing that it was mine (we both have white iPhones), I pressed the home button to view the text message. It was an explicit picture of his genitals, with a dirty caption and hundreds of winky faces. It was most definitely NOT my dad.\u00a0Since then, I have spoken to one friend about it, telling her everything I felt since I couldn\u2019t tell any of my counsellors at school (both of them are very close with my dad) or my sisters. The affair has progressed, I believe, because I discovered my mother has a hotel booked under her name every weekend in our city. Why would she need a hotel in the same city she lives in?",

I was also molested through my diaper by older children as a toddler. I believe these led to the development of my severe, chronic dissociate disorder and OCD. I say all this for context, not as an excuse. As a kid, I had horrible violent and sexually deviant intrusive thoughts as well as PGAD in conjunction with them. I hated them and wanted nothing to do with them and tried to suppress them, but was convinced I was evil. Therapy has helped me realize they weren\u2019t my fault back then. However, as a teen, I decided those thoughts were inevitable and began to let awful scenarios play out in my head instead of rejecting them and masturbated to some of them. I found online communities of people who shared these thoughts but considered them harmless \u201ckinks\u201d when explored only through fiction. I never intended to act on any of them and considered them divorced from my true opinions, but now I see they were still affecting me and I want nothing to do with them. I don\u2019t believe an immoral fantasy can be harmless anymore. I became hyper-sexual and a chronic masturbator. My twin cousins who are 7 years younger than me slept in my room when they visited my house. I was around 15-17. When I knew they had fallen asleep, I silently masturbated. It happened a couple times. I think they were asleep and I don\u2019t think they knew, but it haunts me everyday and the remorse and self-disgust I feel is indescribable. It had nothing to do with their presence, I just wanted to orgasm, but it was SO irresponsible of me no matter how careful I was. In the only other instance of this, I once compulsively touched myself through my pants in an upstairs room of their house, only for a sec, planning to stop before anyone entered. One of them walked in unexpectedly and I was mortified, but pretended I just had an itch, apologized, and went to wash my hands. I don\u2019t know if I can tell my therapist, but it\u2019s eating me alive. I don\u2019t know if these instances count legally as indecency to a minor. If so, I\u2019m ready to turn myself in.

        "Patient Question": "I have been seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist since I was hospitalized in 2012 for a suicide threat. I\u2019ve been treated for depression and anxiety since then and, because nothing has come up since about 2011, I have not opened up about other issues. But lately I can feel something coming on again. Every few months I would go through a few weeks to months of delusions, hallucinations and mood swings usually resulting in me sequestering myself from church, school, friends or whatever else I was involved in. I had a recurring experience of a demonic familiar, visiting other dimensions, and shadow people that seemed to stop when I got a custom tattoo on my back that is an alchemical symbol for demon warding. But it\u2019s starting to slip back. I\u2019m distracted, hear and see things that startle me, and recently put myself in the hospital again when I got so agitated that I cut myself deep enough to damage a tendon. My problem is I just can\u2019t open up in person about exactly what is going on; I feel it coming back like someone following me down a sidewalk, like drowning placidly. I guess what worries me is that I know I\u2019m going somewhere that will harm me but it is familiar and in many ways more real as if it replaces my daily life. Have you ever passed out when really drunk and just before you do you feel like you\u2019re falling into a deep hole that will certainly kill you? It\u2019s like that. I just can\u2019t get myself to talk about it. In the past few weeks I have seen both of my doctors and didn\u2019t feel like wasting their time with this.

During my childhood, my grandma would tell me horrible things about my father such as that he abandoned me, that he doesn\u2019t care about me, etc. which resulted in me not having any kind of relationship with my father up until my late teen years when we started rebuilding it. He and my mother don\u2019t talk and she is convinced that my father wants to turn me against her and this is the reason for many terrible arguments I am having with her which sometimes end in her issuing an ultimatum- either I\u2019ll act the way she wants me to or I can pack my bags and move to my dad\u2019s place. She also claims that I don\u2019t love her or care about her and that I will always prefer my father over her which is not true because for my whole life I wanted them to get along and respect each other. On the other hand, my dad won\u2019t visit me at my place because he could run into my mom since I am living with her. He does hate my mom for all the thing she did to him in the past and is avoiding her completely while she blames him for everything bad that happened to her. Recently my mom started seeing a neuropsychiatrist who diagnosed her with depression and anxiety. Because of that I sometimes avoid certain topics for discussion because I\u2019m afraid she would judge me or get angry with me. For these reasons, I don\u2019t feel close to either one of them nor I have the freedom to talk about my problems with them. Often I feel like they pressure me into picking a side and I am tired of being in that position.I care about them both equally and my love for them could not be measured. Picking a side would only mean hurting one of them. I feel trapped and I don\u2019t know how to act or what to do anymore. (From Sarajevo)",

My norm growing up became sudden shifts of being yelled at and told that I was lazy and selfish, etc\u2026 and my mother threatening me occasionally with her own death, which left me feeling powerless to go live with my dad even though I had a choice. The growth I have done on my own is not sufficient to compensate from the messed up coping mechanisms I learned when I was growing up alone with my BPD mother. Regardless of meditation and journal-ing I am prone to perfectionism, people pleasing to an extreme, and I am just learning now how to establish boundaries so that I am not enmeshed in other people\u2019s lives or completely withdrawn. Since I lived with my mother alone I have had loops of everything she used to tell me I was growing up- all leading up to \u201cno one will love me if I don\u2019t try really really hard to maintain their love\u201d. I often give up on who I am in order to avoid, what I now believe to be, imagined potential conflict. I have been admitting to myself that I am not selfish, I take care of myself. Admitting that I am not lazy, in fact, sometimes I work extremely hard and that has made me successful. I have begun to understand my own values, morals, beliefs, etc. I am trying to shift my modus operendi from self-doubt and \u201cright/wrong-ness\u201d to deciding what I am confident is important to me and standing up for that. I feel like I need a little more support, more literature, and I need to understand better how this upbringing might have affected me otherwise. I want to be the kind of person that is generous, empathetic, considerate, and kind, but I want to have intentions of genuine care rather than fear of someone else hurting me. So what resources are out there? How can I stop thinking that my behavior will affect people\u2019s feelings and stop worrying that I am damaging people?

He drinks a 60 of vodka every 2 1/2 days and 24 beers every 2 or 3 days.

        "Patient Question": "I\u2019m a freshman in high school, just starting therapy bc of social anxiety and mild depression. We\u2019ve had 3 sessions so far. My therapist is a man and I\u2019m a girl, and having anxiety doesn\u2019t make it great when talking with the opposite gender. Ive also avoided telling my therapist about things or lied about it bc I feel uncomfortable sharing my thoughts with someone else. The first time, I admitted about having suicidal thoughts to my therapist, which I\u2019ve never told anyone else before, and I cried a lot afterwards. Having social anxiety makes me genuinely afraid of sharing things with someone else, even though my therapist has told me that he won\u2019t judge me or tell anyone else about it. I\u2019m very used to having thoughts all to myself. My therapist is a very good man, he can talk to me easily even though we\u2019re far from the same age group and encourages me on my hobbies. But sometimes I would pop up thoughts like, \u201che\u2019s just doing this to be nice,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s just part of his job,\u201d etc. I don\u2019t know why these thoughts come up and they bother me a lot.

My late brother was a very social person with a lot of friends, something I envied a lot, and he would often buy things for them, bring them to our house for snack parties, and go out a lot with then, but when he got diagnosed with cancer and was bedridden, they all left. This left a very negative impression about friendship in my head, and I remember my father telling me that friends don\u2019t exist, and that people only like you for what you have. Because of this I avoided making friends and going to social gatherings. To show people I didn\u2019t want any friends, I became a bully. I got in a lot of fights and often insulted people to leave me alone, and used to bully weaker students to make sure no one approached me. I remember very vividly my teacher telling me that people wanted to befriend me but I pushed them away. At the time I didn\u2019t care. However, deep down, I wanted friends, I wanted to belong to a group, but my irrational fear of betrayal got the best o me. To suppress it, I became nastier to people and even started abusing my pet cat. I would often punch and kick the poor thing for no reason other than to release some of my frustration.

We were together full time for 1.5 yrs however it was a long distance relationship taking up to 10 hours each way to see each other. We adored each other and wanted to make it work so made an effort to meet up every 2 weeks. The distance took its toll and when I felt ready to move in with him, he suddenly became very scared (his mum committed suicide 3 yrs before I met him and was quite abusive to him when he was a child) and took a step back which caused no end of heart ache. I knew he still loved me however it was simply impossible to continue as we were. Eventually the frustration of being apart caused us to separate. We decided to take a break- not to break up. But he went into denial and although we were in touch most days during the break, he said that he wanted to stay single. I was dying of heartache and 6 months after our so called break met another man who for the first few months became just a lovely friend, consoling me about my break and helping me, eventually the new chap and I started having a relationship although I had mentioned nothing to the first man (love of\u00a0 my life) as in my head I thought he no longer wished to be together. After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window. The new man was so lovely and kind and fun and all the rest of it but we lacked much sexual intimacy. Fast forward nearly 2 yrs and they are still both in my life, I am in love with both and both are in love with me. I live with the new one but I am dying inside being away from the first.\u00a0 I have seen him and we both don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. Its so painful and I feel so guilty.

        "Patient Question": "Please help me with advice. I am disabled and on social benefit. Am 28 years old. I have no one in my life and even though my main diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenia I have sadly these incurable, negative symptoms. My family is in ruins. Father is in prison and blocking rest of us life. My mother\u2019s health is getting weaker and my brother is going his own way. My mother can\u2019t sell our properties since father disputes over them. Court might take for expenses our properties. My father isn\u2019t cooperating and I have no one in life. Toxic mother and brother who doesn\u2019t communicate with me anymore. I wanted to make my mother happy so she isn\u2019t alone so I helped her find her lover over dating sites. This man is also financially helping us. But I am always either alone or with my mother (sometimes with her lover). I have no one and no love. She says we will live after their (parents) death. I can inherit as disabled survivors pension only after their death. I can star t life after their death. I can\u2019t sleep for days, I have tremors and I barely eat. I constantly cry because I have girl from Philippines which I love. She is only light I have. But knowing I won\u2019t be able to be with her many many years is killing me. I can\u2019t stop crying and with her I burst in tears. I am falling apart. She is comforting me and I consider suicide, but she doesn\u2019t allow me. Pain is too much. I promised her to be with her and marry her next year. But it may be longer\u2026 All the way until first parent dies. I can\u2019t work since my work capability is revoked. If I start working I loose right to inherit survivors pension which is around 1000$. I would never earn that much by work and part time doesn\u2019t exist. Competition ran over me in freelancing. I can\u2019t do anything but wait. Wait what will they decide. But pain and tears never stop. It\u2019s bitter cold loneliness. I simply hold onto my promise to be with her. I will wait, no matter how ill I get in age when I would finally be with her. She is only reason for me to keep living and not doing suicide. I simply am so afraid to lose her. (From Croatia)",

        "Patient Question": " It started recently when I was finishing up my sophomore year of high school. I began to become increasingly paranoid (I thought people were out to get me, and that people kept staring at me, even if I was alone), that people could hear my thoughts, and I kept feeling like there was some sort of presence near me, and/or following me. Not only that, but I would have the occasional auditory hallucination. I didn\u2019t hear voices, but rather noises people make such as breathing (as if someone were right next to me)r when I was alone (happened twice), a snarl (also as if someone were right next to me), and an exhale (right next to me; alone) , however these are minor compared to the visual hallucinations. These occurred in the corner of my eye. I would see moving shadows, full blown people (I would see them moving, sand they would be extremely detailed, but when I looked back they were never there in the first place.[this occurred 3 times]), and sometimes pictures would look like they were moving or finishing an action. Some of my other visual hallucinations I could see directly such as a face at the top of a door (occurred once), and one time I was sitting in drivers Ed and my teacher was talking about bugs when all of the sudden I see two black dots swarming around her head like flies, but it didn\u2019t last long until they flew behind her head and disappeared. Another time I was sitting in a car and I saw a fly, fly right up to my face, so I swatted at it, but I realized that there wasn\u2019t actually a fly, because I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere, neither did I hear the buzzing of its wings. Another instance is when I thought I saw a bug crawling down my arm, but I didn\u2019t feel it, nor did I see it where it should have ended up. Another time u thought I saw a bug crawling across my wall, but again I didn\u2019t see it where it was suppose to end up (on the ceiling; it was crawling up). Not only that but when I walked down the hallways of my school, they would appear to be crooked, and moving, causing me to walk funny. Then there is other stuff like my loss of motivation, emotion (not flat effect), I would miss letters when I wrote, I began talking to my inner voice as if it were real (it talked to me first), I now have a bad attention span, and it\u2019s now fairly hard to get my point across because I\u2019ll get tongue tied, plus my personal hygiene is not the best, and my memory (especially short term) seems to be increasingly getting worse. That last part could be due to my dysthymia, but it still doesn\u2019t explain the rest of the things I\u2019ve been experiencing. I never have and never will use drugs, and I don\u2019t take any medications. Thank you for your time.",

        "Patient Question": "When taking a polygraph, my former step-son keeps creating scenarios that never occurred. We know this because they are about other family members. When the family member is questioned about rather something actually happened or not, they deny the scenario ever occurring. My former step-son is borderline developmentally delayed, had ADHD (and is off his meds because the school said he doesn\u2019t need them, so we are having difficulty with behaviors at home including: lying, impulsivity such as stealing, emotional outbursts, being spiteful (telling me he doesn\u2019t want me in his *blank* life when angry)), and he\u2019s bipolar. He also hears hallucinations from time to time but ignores them. He is currently on probation for a crime I believe he didn\u2019t commit (but I\u2019m not the law). The scenario happened at his mother\u2019s apartment. However, when I first questioned him about it before he started his court appointed therapy, he told me it happened at his friend\u2019s house. He was very confused about the details until his court appointed therapy. He has no concept of time, due to his cognitive impairment. He says things happened a few months ago, which really happened two years ago. Then gets in trouble for it and DCF is called to investigate. Recently, on his last polygraph (he has taken two), he admitted to doing something this January. The counselor kept asking him what happened in January. Finally, he imagined something that happened and told them. They said they have to get DCF back out to talk to him and he may be going back to jail. After talking with cousin he supposedly did something with, we know that nothing happened. Why does he keep admitting to things he didn\u2019t do? Why does he keep imagining things that never happened? (He once told me a scenario that if it had happened, his cousin would have never talked to him again. When I asked him for details, he couldn\u2019t provide them. I\u2019m pretty sure he imagined that too.) Thank you for your time.",

It all started with me face-planting to my mom\u2019s breast get a split second turn on. I felt disgusted by myself, wanted to die, thought that I don\u2019t deserve to live or even go to heaven. I thought I belong to hell. I always tried to check if I get turned on by thinking a sexual thing about my mom and I felt disgusted by myself more and more. But I\u2019ve left it behind when my doctor said that it\u2019s normal to get turned on because I face-planted to a women\u2019s breast and my body reacted to it. Then after suffering these, I started thinking that I am a pedophile. It all started with me getting sexual thoughts from a child anime character who\u2019s name is kanna kamui . She has very thick thighs and wears thigh high socks. Let me say that have a kink about thigh high socks. It all happened again. Disgusting myself, thinking I belong to hell, and not wanting to live. I always checked her pictures to see if I get turned on or not. Which I did n\u2019t. My doctor said that I am not a pedophile as well and suffering from POCD. So with that I always said YOU\u2019RE NOT A PEDOPHILE to myself. I didn\u2019t get any intrusive thoughts about having a sex with children so that helped me as well. And yesterday I\u2019ve gone to my doctor saying that I am not taking medications anymore and I was feeling great. He did some tests on me and I\u2019ve passed all of them. I was happy, better than before. But that day I said okay I am gonna look at the pictures of that child anime girl and think having sex with my mom to see if I get turned on or not if i don\u2019t then I\u2019ll be happy forever. You know what happened? Split second turn on both of them. Now I want to die again. I don\u2019t want to accept that I am a pedophile nor incester. Now I check pictures of that girl and think sexual things about my mom to see if I get turned on but i don\u2019t. But why did I felt that split second turn on? Was it because I was scared that it\u2019ll get it? I am not seeing myself having sex with my mom even if it\u2019s possible. I am not seeing myself having sex with children even if it was ok and legal. I don\u2019t fantasize about children nor my mom. I don\u2019t get turned on by looking at children. I can say that they look good, their legs look good. But not in a sexually aroused way. I just ask myself that if their legs look good or do they look good and say yes or no. I don\u2019t fantasize about their face or get romantically aroused by their face. Am I a pedophile and incest or is it POCD? Please help me. (From Turkey)",

He went to see some friends and partied for 3 days, he said he only drank. When he came home he was hearing voices and uncontrollable we took him to a hosp. and they admitted him and gave him some medication. He went into outpatient therapy, but that was not helping with his problems he needed one on one. We went to a social worker and she said he wanted to hurt himself so she called cops and had him admitted. He was there for 10 days because he did not want to take meds. He\u2019s in outpatient again and the doctor has him on 1mg at night and 10mg Abilify. I cut the abilify to 5mg because when he was on 10mg he heard more voices and holding his head all the time and not functioning. The doctor still thinks he should be on 5mg in morning and 5mg towards evening. We tried that and the next day he was so bad we thought we were going to bring him to the hosp. again. I called the office and they said the dr. Knows what he is doing and I should listen to them. When I did not give him the extra Abilify yesterday he seemed much calmer and wanted to do something. I am not sure what to do next I have been looking for other doctors but either they don\u2019t take our insurance or they don\u2019t have any openings for a few months. Is it possible someone age 30 can be ok and 3 days later be schizoaffective who never had any signs. And what medication is good. Thank you from a concerned parent.",

To the point that I cringe at the thought of having to visit them or them visit us. For me, out of sight is out of mind. I could go for months without calling or meeting anyone and I would be perfectly fine with it. When I finally call, it is out a sense of guilt. I cannot stand any kind of social gathering.

But here\u2019s a brief picture of my childhood. I grew up with my mom and younger brother and we lived with my paternal grandmother and uncles, since my father was working in another country. This is quite typical in our culture. As a child, I don\u2019t have any memory of negative experiences until the age of 8 or 9. We moved to another house, because of some differences between mom and grandmother. Unfortunately, I was sexually abused by two of my neighbors at this house. People my mother trusted. One a 15-year-old and the other in his late 20\u2019s. I was doing well at school in academics and athletics. Few years later, that started deteriorating too. I had some publicly humiliating experiences from some of my teachers too. It doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to me now but to my teenage self it was pretty big. I also had inappropriate touching from strangers while out with friends and I always felt that I was somehow singled out by these characters. I literally felt I had a label on my forehead saying touch me. Thankfully I married to a wonderful man and I\u2019m doing well career wise. Except for this aspect. Help!",

        "Patient Question": "My friend died earlier 2011 of suicide; only a few months into the year as a matter of fact. I met her in September 2009 my senior year of High School, and spent time with her every day or every other day, for varying lengths of the day (sometimes a whole class -we had gym for the first half of that school year- and some 5 minute periods before and after the last class, sometimes only those 5 minute periods). We also saw each other at dances and such. And we became close friends, and I eventually considered her a best friend. And, as a matter of fact, had feelings for her beyond friends. We hung out together throughout my Senior year, though it became less in the second half the year (we no longer had gym the second half, though we still met before and after the last two classes of the day with our group of friends, and eventually that half of the year I went to her lunch period to spend time). I took this girl to prom (though nothing intimate occurred as we were not dating), was with her at 3 graduation parties (one being my own), and a few other event though not more than maybe 2. Once I graduated was when we steadily stopped seeing each other. I kept in touch on Facebook, and Texted what I thought at the time was quite a lot (I believe it was once a week or once every two weeks at least), but whenever I asked to hangout, they were always busy. I still considered her close and important friend for all that happened in that year I knew her, because we had gotten very close. This period after we stopped seeing one another at all is the Fall and Winter of 2010.

I had psychotherapy in my late 20s, early 30\u2019s and was relatively okay til I got to mid 50s. I should also mention I take care of my younger sister who has fibromyalgia and who lives with me. Because of the pain she\u2019s in, she can\u2019t shop, cook, clean etc. so I do it all. I love her a lot, but this is draining and makes me angry at times. Not sure what to do.

I can\u2019t imagine not having him in my life. I\u2019ve never loved anyone like i love him. The only problem is that we fight all the time. He literally drives me crazy and we are hardly ever happy anymore. We broke up for a short while a few months back and during this time i had sex with a guy who i sort of had a thing with several years back but it was never serious. The entire time me and my boyfriend dated this guy had tried to get back with me and i always secretly wanted to be with him but i knew he wasn\u2019t really the relationship type of guy as he would often go days or even weeks without calling. Anyway, I contracted genital herpes from this guy and even after telling my boyfriend about it he still took me back which proves to me that he really does love me, even if he doesn\u2019t always show it. Even though me and my boyfriend got back together I still hang out with the other guy occasionally and for some reason he makes me so much happier than my boyfriend. Me and him never fight and he talks to me with so much more respect and makes me feel so much more loved than my boyfriend does. He can make me feel ways that i never feel around my boyfriend and i don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m afraid to let go of my boyfriend to be with him though when i don\u2019t think he\u2019ll stick around and i don\u2019t want to cheat anymore. I have tried to just not talk to either one and find someone else but i just can\u2019t like anyone else as much as i try. So how do i know who to choose, the one i have a strong bond with and love and know loves me but is mean to me and starts fights with me all the time or the guy who is always sweet to me and makes me happy but isn\u2019t always around and won\u2019t be serious with me?",

They had been together for 10 years (since he was 20 and she 19), lived together for 2. She was the first and only girl he ever dated and was completely committed to raising a family with her. In November his wife started a new job, and in March this year she left him. He is completely devastated. When it happened, he cut off all relationships and we were not able to see or talk to him for a whole month. At that time he was still hoping that she would go back to him, and was waiting for her at their home. When it became clear that she wouldn\u2019t come back, he moved back home with the family. For 2 weeks, he would just lay in bed staring at the ceiling, and couldn\u2019t sleep at night. My mother and I stayed close to him and whenever he wanted to, we would talk and discuss what had happened with him. At least he started to go to work. He is a very introverted person, and he had invested so much in that relationship at the expense of other relationships in his life. He has very few friends and he is not really close to family members. It seemed that things got a bit better. He started going out at times, and he started sleeping again. It has been 3 months since, but he is not capable of moving on. He has shut down again, doesn\u2019t want to talk to us, doesn\u2019t go out, has no interest on anything. We are trying to convince him to see a psychologist, but he won\u2019t go. He feels that his life has no meaning any more and he feels like he is suffocating in this life. He thinks now, that the only solution would be to move to some other country and start a new life. How can we help him? What else can we do to make him see that there is still life ahead? What can we say to him? Thank you in advance.",

        "Patient Question": "I\u2019ve been happily single-by-choice for many years. Definitely not even considering ANY possibility of new \u201cromantic\u201d relationship. Out of NOWHERE, I started constantly thinking about & plotting ways to spend time with a man approx 15 yrs younger than I. He works evenings & nights as a security guard where I reside. He\u2019s been working here for approx. 6 mos. I\u2019d seen & even spoken briefly to him several times previously, but without a hint of warning I became \u201ccloser\u201d (no physical exchanges due to my faith & beliefs). Here\u2019s the kicker: he couldn\u2019t be FURTHER from what has always been my \u201ctype\u201d. Where I live there are many different nationalities & people from many diverse ethnic backgrounds. I\u2019ve always been attracted first & foremost, by physical appearance & to races other than mine (Caucasian). This \u201cyoung man\u201d is Hispanic, having only arrived in Hawaii last year, and is pure WHITE, skinny, shaved head, big ears & a horrible physique. Now\u2019s the time to add the fact of my extremely good, rare physical shape-not only for \u201cmy age\u201d but for women in general. I\u2019ve had 5 large babies but have always been very athletic-serious weight-lifting for many years as well as running, canoe-paddling etc. In 2009 I realized my 35-year dream & underwent an abdominoplasty which removed 2 lbs. of loose skin only-no liposuction needed-& complete abdominal muscle restoration (stretch marks & scars are history & I\u2019ve had extensive tattooing over the surgical scars. People think I\u2019m \u201cfibbing\u201d when they learn about my large family because my body definitely is not the \u201cnorm\u201d in the many-children dept. I\u2019m 5\u2032 2\u2033, still somewhat muscular, have long, straight hair (in which I keep all traces of white from becoming obvious) & am feisty & energetic. I\u2019m certainly not movie-star gorgeous but not too shabby for 61* So\u2026what is up with my totally out-of-character attraction to this guy? He has a beautiful accent I call \u201cSprench\u201d for Spanish/French because it sounds like a little of both. He\u2019s been very kind & considerate but I think I\u2019ve frightened him with my hyper, \u201cdog-with-a-bone\u201d personality. He\u2019s separated from his wife, who\u2019s in CA. I mean, if my kids ever knew about this they\u2019d think I\u2019d totally lost it. I have 2 bodybuilder sons & all my children are super attractive, as are their kids. What do I do???",

Around the age of 12 my mother made it seem to me that ballet was the only thing i could do in my life and i had no other option but to do it. Ballet made me hate myself, i constantly felt like i was not good enough and even my teachers would tell me i wasnt good enough. So i quit ballet and everything went downhill from there. I made a bad decision just like im sure every teenager has done once in their life. I went to hang out with friends during the day without telling my parents when i moved 1000 ft away. instead of being grounded for a week or two i was told all of these horrible things such as your a failure, your a disappointment, your a whore, your a slut, no one likes you, your trash, you have no real friends, kill yourself. Ever since then (that was around 6 months ago) ive been told that every day. My whole life has been one bad event after an other and nothing ever seems to get better. I have no one to talk to about how i feel and dont know how to fix this. I feel like nothing will ever be better for me and im starting to believe that i am what my mom tells me. I cry every day for at least 4 hours. I dont sleep at night anymore. I eat junk food constantly. I however have still managed to focus in school and get good grades because i know if i do that the closer ill be to leaving my parents and finding happiness. These past 6 months I\u2019ve never felt worse and things haven\u2019t worked out for me in even the slightest bit. I feel like if im living in this house with someone who sees me a certain way and accuses me of being someone im not, the only way out is to kill myself. Ive tried many times but get stopped by fear.

I also was always afraid of death and therefore also of cancer, heart attacks also. Now I had a panic attack 3 months ago that kicked off thoughts and high fear of suicide. I was so afraid that u went straight to a psychological clinic where I was diagnosed with OCD and a panic disorder. I am lucky, not afraid of driving or knives or anything like that because I really don\u2019t want to die so I don\u2019t think I am a risk for myself. But that now first kicked off the huge fear of a major depression that could change my attitude one day towards the fact that I don\u2019t want to die. Luckily I could also reassure myself that I don\u2019t have depression because I don\u2019t really show any symptoms like listlessness or loss of happiness in activities. I also still see my friends a lot. But I somehow still are very sensitive towards my emotions and anything around me that sound like death depression, sadness, suicide or stuff like that. That stuff scares me. For example, when somebody is making a joke about me I instantly check myself to make sure I am not sad or mad or anything. That goes along with a lot of ruminations about the topics of OCD, suicide, anxiety and psychological disorders itself. I also sometimes have the feeling of derealization when I feel anxious and insecure. And since some days the fear of becoming schizophrenic or psychotic came up heavily. I don\u2019t have any hallucinations or hear anything that isn\u2019t there but the occasional surreal feeling of the world around me freaks me out. I am so scared that I could harm myself in psychosis. I also never took drugs or had any psychological disease in my family. Does that sound to you like an upcoming psychosis or something like that or is it just my OCD that freaks me out? (From Germany)",

I can look at my friend and smile at the thought of sliding a knife into their chest. Often I have conversations with the person in my head I have come to know as Toby Bryers.

Sometimes he tells me to do things I know i shouldn\u2019t. such as challenge a higher class human (aka: adult) or even hurt someone or disobey rules. This ends in us bickering and me winning. He says he wants to take me to higher places that humans are to idiotic to understand. I believe him but.. if the occasion that this is untrue.. well.. I don\u2019t want to get into trouble.

I got home from work and started feeling terrible. I felt like nothing mattered and that life had no point. Since then I have had difficulty with suicidal thoughts, depersonalization and derealization. Sometimes I feel like part of me is watching over me, and that it wants me to join it in heaven. Other times I get scared when I\u2019m around loved ones because I know they are going to die one day, and that I\u2019ll be left without them. I also get scared that I\u2019m going to die, that I could end my life without realizing I\u2019m doing it. How I feel seems to vary by the day, but they are not mood swings from high to low, just low to lower. When I\u2019m walking around sometimes I feel like I may be in heaven already, especially when I\u2019m walking through scenic environments. If I see something especially pretty or out of place I feel like I may be imagining it. Even going to the lake is enough to make me wonder if I\u2019m real. This feeling doesn\u2019t ever go away. I get overwhelmed extremely easily, and sometimes feel like I\u2019m in a fog. Situations as simple as having a conversation at work or going to the store can make me feel like there\u2019s too much going on, and that I\u2019m about to wake up from a coma or a dream.

Sometimes it won\u2019t stop for forty five minutes to an hour. It happens at random times. For example, i\u2019ll wake up in the morning with only the first line of a chorus stuck in my head and it\u2019ll just keep repeating until it fades away on its own. The insults: I feel if I don\u2019t repeatedly say them to myself out loud they\u2019ll just repeat in my head like the song lyric. The insults are explicit and I don\u2019t mean to call myself such derogatory things but I feel like they\u2019re being directed at me by someone else in my head. I have to keep repeating them until I feel I don\u2019t need to anymore. I do have terrible anxiety and both issues get worse when I\u2019m more anxious than my baseline level of anxiety that\u2019s always with me. I never feel like there\u2019s a quiet moment in my head. Everything circulates so quickly that sometimes I can\u2019t grab onto a full thought and I end up confusing myself on what i\u2019m thinking or how i\u2019m feeling. I can only sleep after I stay up so late that I exhaust myself completely and that\u2019s when some of my brain slows down. I never know how i\u2019m going to wake up feeling or \u201cwho\u201d, in a sense, i\u2019m going to wake up as. I feel as if that confusion also stems from the\u00a0 rapid fire of thoughts always in my head. One moment i\u2019m thinking of a fun memory, the next instant i\u2019m thinking of death, then philosophy, then my future, then video games, then literature . . . it just goes on and on like someone repeatedly opens an encyclopedia, randomly points to a definition, then immediately flips to a different page and randomly chooses another definition before I could read the first definition. I\u2019m never long on one thought. Could this be a product of anxiety? It\u2019s both advantageous and bothersome as it makes me a quick thinker but not very good at focusing; it\u2019s hard to read and I\u2019ve got another semester coming this September.

I can remember right before I started school, when I was 4 or 5. Then there is about 2 or 3 years that is completely lost. I have never though much about until here of late. It all centers around a place that me and my family stayed. It was a duplex and I don\u2019t remember living there at all. I remember that house before that and the one after. The first memory I have of the house we lived in after the duplex is me and my older brother \u201cexploring ourselves\u201d. It was more then a \u201cyou show me yours and I\u2019ll show you mine.\u201d I feel so ashamed about that and cannot figure out for the life of me WHY we did that?? I can remember touching my stuffed animals in inappropriate places and even doing the same things with another girl that was my age. I started having sex at a very early age, around 12, and haven\u2019t stopped since. In fact, that is really the only risk taking behavior I have ever really had. From somewhere, and I don\u2019t know where, it has been imprinted on my mind that if you care someone, that\u2019s how you show it. I have never had any other experiences with my brother since that very young age, but I know that we did it more then once. I am just wondering were all this was coming from. I recently started having dreams of my brother and me now. I know, it sounds sick, but I can\u2019t help it. This is also something that we have never talked about since it happened. I have also been having like these flashbacks of this man that used to come to the house that I don\u2019t remember living in. (I know he was there from what my brothers have told me) In the scenarios, I am a little girl, around 5,6 or 7. I am yelling for my daddy, (my parents were separated at the time we lived in this house also) and a man in a police uniform, tucking me into bed and telling me to quit yelling and the he loved me and putting his hand over my mouth. I started to investigate this man and he was arrested in 2001 for 7 counts of indecent liberties with a minor spanning from 1976 to 2001. The accusers were girls that he babysat for other women and his daughter. I am just wondering if maybe my mind has blocked out the span of those years for a reason. Is that possible?? Is that why me and brother were \u201cexploring\u201d each other?? It would in fact explain a lot of my behavior. I have anxiety issues now, but I to scared to see a therapist. I am getting married in May and I am scared that if this comes out, he will think differently of me because of what occurred with one of my brothers?? It is possible I am freaking out over nothing??",

Can she be fully conscious that their actions are wrong, knowing she understands right from wrong fully, and be able to change her behavior?

I believe I may have BPD, because I\u2019ve always had many problems with abandonment, instability of relationships and mood swings, and I also meet all the symptoms of the disorder(even substance abuse and self harm).I\u2019ve always had a confuse sense of identity,I\u2019ve never really known who I was, and experienced dissociation and depersonalisation since the age of 11. I identify as nonbinary even though I was born female, but I know this could be a consequence of BPD.My therapist doesn\u2019t know about my condition because she just keeps asking me only about my anxiety and everytime I try to tell her something of the above she seems to not be even listening to me. I\u2019m writing this because recently something changed.I\u2019ve always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it\u2019s been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s real anymore.I have nightmares and most of the days I don\u2019t know if what I experience is real or not.I see the younger me as a weak, pathetic girl who knew nothing about anything but I don\u2019t even remember how she was or what she liked. There\u2019s this other part of me, though, called Chrissie. She\u2019s a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine \u2013 sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I\u2019m high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID. I\u2019m very unsure about the amnesia that should incurr though, because I happen to be co-present when she takes control, but she does what she wants and I later feel like someone else has controlled my body even though I know what happened.When I dissociate while I\u2019m writing something I can\u2019t remember later what I was writing before, and I noticed I have very few memories of my life before my 14th birthday, but nothing more than this.",

        "Patient Question": "When I was young, maybe 7 or 8, I was watching Blue Hawaii and there is this scene where Elvis takes this girl over his knee and spanks her because she tried to kill herself by driving into the lake\u2026when I say girl, I guess I really mean young woman. Anyways, ever since I saw that scene, I was really intrigued and curious. I had never seen a man spank a full grown woman. The only thing I could relate spanking to was the abuse that I witnessed my mother perpetrate in my home. But this scene didn\u2019t seem like what my mom did. So anyways after that every time the topic of spanking was broached, I got this feeling of anticipation\u2026like just hearing or reading the word made me excited, for lack of a better word. When I was in 8th grade I started looking at things on the internet that had to do with adult spanking. This led me to the domestic discipline sights that talk about spanking in a relationship. I became engrossed to say the least. I read all the DD stories. And decided that I couldn\u2019t be in a relationship that did not include me getting a sound spanking when I deserved one\u2026 Also, another aspect that I think may be relevant is the fact that I have struggled with self injury off and on for 5 years.I was wondering if that somehow correlates with my spanking needs\u2026 but the real issue I guess is\u2026is this a healthy expression? Is there something wrong with my desire to be disciplined by my mate?",

I want him in the delivery room when I go into labor but my family thinks it\u2019s the wrong choice. He was arrested for unlawful eavesdropping and survalince. He was bonded out after 2 days. My parents think I am a bad parent for wanting him to be there knowing what he did. I need to know what others think because I love my kids and never want to lose them and at this time my parents are telling me they will take my kids. And they know I would never let that happen. I have always been controlled by my parents and they feel like their own opinion is the only and right one. Please help and give me your honest opinion. My dad feels like I need to talk to a therapist and this is a lot for a pregnant woman to handle without someone to talk to. I think my parents are taking it too far to say that since he did this he will mess with my kids. The camera was also never used and had to be used within my mom\u2019s home so I don\u2019t think he knew how it worked before putting it there.",

        "Patient Question": "I am just trying to figure out if my childhood sexplay with a younger same sex cousin was normal or abuse. It all started with her wanting to comb my hair. She had to be 6 or 7 and I about 8 or 9. It went from combing my hair to rubbing my shoulders to us kissing. Eventually it lead to us touching. She would come over every now and then and we would experiment. I think eventually it led to oral by her suggestion because she would engage in the same activity with her mother\u2019s daughter\u2019s friend. I stopped once I got caught dry humping another girl who was around my age. My mom didn\u2019t scold me but had a sit down with myself and the other girl along with the other mom to say it was inappropriate. My cousin would still come over to spend the night and rub against my leg to make me join in sexual play but I would say no firmly and kick her hand or foot off me. I guess my guilt stems from me being older. I should have known better. And I feel absolutely terrible about it. It keeps me up all night sometimes. I don\u2019t remember her trying to force me other than the rubbing leg incident. And I don\u2019t remember me forcing her to do anything. When I think about it I think she was far more advanced mentally than I was. My aunts house did not have the same rules as mine. The kids watched whatever they wanted even R-rated movies as they always had televisions in their room. When I would go over their house they would always call me \u201cslow\u201d because I didn\u2019t get certain things. I guess being that I wasn\u2019t street smart like them and was sheltered (no tv in the rooms only age appropriate shows). Anyway these sexual play encounters have really plagued my with tremendous guilt recently. I don\u2019t want to think that I molested my younger cousin. I turned very mean to her to nip all attempts of sexual play in the bud. To make her hate me was a mechanism to keep us safe and appropriate I guess. She eventually came out as bisexual. I don\u2019t want to think that I did this to her.. Please please help me figure this one out. I\u2019ve been struggling for years.",

In college he had a short phase where he was a bit more social. It is now about 4 years since he has graduated college. In that time he has not worked any job. He gets angry when people try to tell him to think about the future and what he wants to do with his life. He lives alone in an apartment that my parents own in Queens (we live on Long Island). He barely goes outside. He orders things to his apartment, even food so he doesnt go outside (he doesn\u2019t know how to drive either). He mainly just plays video games online and sleeps. It seems like he has some hidden form of cash flow that we do not know of since he buys himself things on Amazon quite frequently. He is extremely moody and can get in quite negative angry moods towards others. This has been 4 years and I am not sure what to do. He himself does not seem open for us trying to help, when my parents try to have a more serious talk with him he gets extremely angry and then will say extreme things to get them to stop talking, like \u201cThis will be the last you will ever see me. I will move to Sweden\u201d (he is currently dating a girl online from Sweden who has recently come to visit him in NY).

Eventually Jyl spoke out about the matter but never speak out about the role she played in the situation. I didn t even defend myself when she (Jyl) confessed it all, I just put on a strong face, but I was crying on the inside. Eventually everyone found out about it, as you know words spread like bush fire. In high school I was bullied for it and other rumors that Jyl and my so call friends created about me.",

        "Patient Question": "I think I might need help. For as long as I can remember I\u2019ve always been depressed. I just shrugged it off as boredom till I got into highschool and I decided to actually accept it as depression. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m depressed. Maybe I don\u2019t even have a reason but it\u2019s just how I feel. I\u2019ve attempted suicide a couple times before but I just couldn\u2019t do it. All I ever think about is dying but I think I\u2019m getting worse. Because I\u2019ve started having thoughts about hurting others as well. Not that I would do such a thing! I abhor violence and wouldn\u2019t even hurt a fly. However a couple years ago I had a kind of mental breakdown. I\u2019m night owl you see, so for some reason one night I just started freaking out. I was extremely paranoid for no reason. I was so scared of something that I started carrying a knife with me to protect myself. After a couple weeks of this I stopped. But, with these new thoughts I\u2019m having, I\u2019m worried that if I have another breakdown I might hurt someone. I\u2019m scaring myself. Recently several people close to me have died and I\u2019m not even bothered by it. I didn\u2019t cry or get upset, I didn\u2019t even act surprised. I mean I accept death as an inevitable but these were people close to me, shouldn\u2019t I be the least bit sad? I\u2019m not sure what I should do. Do I have a problem and/or should I get help?

I feel guilty for being so upset because there are other people whose experiences are so, so much worse than mine, but I am still having a hard time getting over it. I am now with a really amazing man who knows about what happened. He really tries to be supportive, but has a difficult time understanding. He gets angry because he doesn\u2019t understand why I allowed someone to do that to me for so long. He thinks that I stayed for so long because I actually enjoyed being sexually abused, and although he doesn\u2019t mean to, he makes me feel like he thinks I am disgusting. He also says that it feels dirty and wrong to instigate anything intimate with me, because unless I initiate it, he feels like I won\u2019t tell him if it\u2019s something I don\u2019t want. He tries so hard to keep me from feeling like I have to do anything and is so worried about making me feel the way that my ex did that I\u2019m afraid to tell him when something he does triggers me, because even though I assure him he has done nothing wrong, he still feels like it\u2019s his fault.

I get so bad it effects my ability to be a good mother or worker. I would lay in bed and avoid doing the most minor life tasks (even taking care of my asthma bringing me to almost die).

We told each other that if we make a purchase above $1,000, then we would discuss it with the other person. Next, he wanted to buy a 14k gun. He told me and I told him that if he got it them we would not be on good terms. The seller raised the price so he told me that he was not getting it. We found that he is not divorced. I asked him how did this happen and he told me that she sent him fake papers so he thought everything was taken care of. Plus she told him that she was remarried. Now He has been telling me that he does not trust me with money. I have not made a big purchase or anything. I have told him that money is tight for me but I am in a profession where you get paid a lot. One day, he asked me if my dad could do a certified check (he is a banker). I asked him why he needed that. He told me he wanted to get the gun. The gun that we both agreed that he would not get. Finally he tells me that he wanted to ask his dad before he told me that he wanted to get the gun. The next day, I find out that he knew that he was married before we were even together. He even told me that the girl he dated once he told her that he is still married and she is fine with it. What to do? The wedding is in 7 months. (From the USA)",

He doesn\u2019t have many friends and he prefers to be home on his own which at first I had no problem with because I am a homebody myself. However, after a while, I noticed he had intimacy issues which then rose quite a few problems within our relationship. He distances himself quite often, becomes very cold. He also shared with me that he was sexually abused when he was young but he didn\u2019t go into detail and I did not ask questions because I felt like he didn\u2019t want to talk about it so I comforted him and we have not spoken about it since. I also know he did not come from a good background. He has also gone through my phone and found some messages from social media. The trust was fully broken then but after a couple months of separation, we decided to work out the relationship. A couple of days ago, he became very distant and I began to worry what was on his mind. He finally opened up and told me he suspects his roommates are plotting to get him. I reassured him that that was all in his head and to stay positive. He also bought a knife for protection which I didn\u2019t think much of. However last night, he smoked a little bit of marijuana (he has before and has never acted weird) and after an hour, he began to shake uncontrollably. I had asked him what was going on but he told me he was just cold and told me to go to bed. As I am laying next to him, I couldn\u2019t help but notice his behavior. He was still shaking, his heart was pounding and he was looking straight at the door and noticed he was holding a knife in his hand as he looked like he was prepared for whatever was going to happen. I began to worry even more and he suggested we leave his place.. it was 2am. While we were in the car, he began to suspect I was hiding something from him. He kept saying \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u201d and began interrogating me and went through my phone again believing I was out to set him up. I was afraid for my safety and I told him to get out of my car, he got a lyft and just left. I have not heard from him since and I am still worried about his mental state. What should I do?

Then another bombshell; the other friend began to ignore me, and when I asked the other friend if they where ignoring them as well, they said yes. Only an hour later did I send the friend a message while the other was streaming, only to see\u00a0\u201d __ messaged me again..\u201d. I felt my heart crush under unbearable weight, and it is burned in my mind. after 2 months, I quietly cut ties with one, and after overcoming my fears, cut ties with the other. At that time, I had a 3 hour long panic attack. 2 months later I found myself in an abusive relationship. They intervened once more, teaming up on me on my social media, their intent to kill me. During these events as a whole, I practiced self harm and had suicidal thoughts. I thought it was all my fault, even if I\u2019d been told it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0I would like to know if this may have caused PTSD. I am still having flashbacks and panic attacks, as well as hypersensitivity. The symptoms are getting worse. I feel the sting every day.

Other people have noticed my father seems indifferent too, so I know I\u2019m not imagining it. I have read about Asperger\u2019s and my father seems to display many of the symptoms. He has no friends and never has, he doesn\u2019t like social situations such as party\u2019s, weddings, Christmas or New Year. He is highly sensitive to sound and light and often complains about things being too loud and too bright. On occasion he also exhibits hand flapping and finger twisting. He has throughout his entire life shown little interest in me or my brother, in fact all he shows is anger. Furthermore I have noticed that he feels very awkward and uncomfortable around children, even his own grandchildren and at one point wouldn\u2019t even go near them, talk to them or hold them when they were babies. And when in social situations such as parties or family gatherings he seems vacant \u2014 aloof at times and can become very clumsy, knocking things over. He misses the punchline of jokes and often fails to understand conversations by saying things another person has already said or talking about something completely unrelated.",

I don\u2019t take any meds or hormones, don\u2019t drink coffee, don\u2019t eat sugar, get plenty of sleep (10 hours average), am not over worked, live a very low-stress life style, eat organic, go hiking at least few times a month and smaller walks more frequently, and have a very patient boyfriend of 3 years. The thing is I have very little sexual drive, except when I\u2019m on my period, have no inspiration or creativity(I used to be very artistic), and almost every day, no matter what part of my cycle I\u2019m in, I have at least one angry melt down where something went wrong(like trying to flip an egg and it doesn\u2019t flip right and the yolk breaks) and sometimes it happens multiple times a day. I actually avoid cooking eggs now because I suck at flipping them. These melt-downs rarely end in tears though. I just get really really mad and I feel my temperature rise. I kind of wish I could cry more actually, and I\u2019m wondering if hard drug use in my teenage years has affected me, and is still affecting me 5 years later.

I had a brief (few months) relation with a boy 12 years ago that was ended and then confessed to the parents of the child. Since then, over the years, there have been recurrant thoughts and indulgence in certain types of media and, for a short time, online chatting. This has all stopped, and I am in therapy now (having revealed all of the above to the therapist, who informed me of her legal obligations and professional concern\u2026everything addressed as it should be), of my own volition. I have also brought this up to my circle of friends, and thereby lost most of them. My life is very difficult right now, but I\u2019ve so far been able to keep myself from the old habits and look into ways of changing. What I\u2019m glad about is that I\u2019m doing this without being forced to. As thrilling as it was to have a dirty secret, it\u2019s worthwhile for me to not feel like I\u2019m hunted and a monster. I\u2019m glad that, even though technically, I could be jailed for whatI\u2019ve done, I have brought this into the light without getting caught and thrown away. I\u2019 m doing this, not because and the state says I must, but because I say I must. I\u2019m glad that some people have been very understanding and supportive. I am still loved. What worries me are three main concerns: Firstly, I wonder about myself. There were times in the past when I decided to give it up, but I started looking at stuff again (the almost-entire majority of this thing was looking at pics/vids) and then that would continue for a while. I know I have to change. It\u2019s either move forward on the path I\u2019m on, or end up perpetuating a cycle that thrives on the exploitation of those who don\u2019t comprehend exactly how they\u2019re being used. It seems like many things in my life\u2026many grand ideas\u2026get left behind like forgotten toys. I don\u2019t want that to happen with this. I\u2019ve heard of the recidivism rate of offenders and it\u2019s a bit daunting. My prime hope is the theraputic process.

His death was due to very critical health problems that resulted in 100 days in a hospital that ended with a massive heart attack in the hospital. I was with him when he passed. My concern is where are all the people who were there for me prior? Why do friends stop calling, etc. Prior to all this, I had a fairly good social life. However I always seemed to be the one reaching out, making dinner dates, planning get togethers. I do work full time and was my husbands caregiver for awhile, but I always made sure I made time for my friends. Now that I am alone, nobody ever reaches out, still. You would think they would realize I lost the love of my life and reach out to me. Make sure I am ok, invite me to lunch. I can count on one hand the number of friends who have checked on me. Is losing friends normal during grief? I mean even my husbands old friends, the guy who did the funeral ( a longtime friend), even my husbands family! (out of his 4 siblings, 1 has reached out) I spend a lot of time alone. I work, spend lots of time with my grandkids, but as far as a social life, its almost nothing. Part of me is angry that here I am going thru the worst thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and where are the people who came to the funeral, said they are there for me? Why NOW is it still up to me to be the initiator? I am doing ok with the grieving process and have made great progress in the last 12 months, except for THIS. Even some co-workers ignore the situation, my own boss doesn\u2019t even ask how I am, ever. Not once since the funeral. (I love my job and have been at my job 31 years. This last year has shown me tho, nobody wants to deal with a grieving person) I never imagined friendships would disappear after such a loss.",

I know that I must have depression, because no matter what I do those feelings of helplessness towards myself keep coming back. But I don\u2019t know what I have, really. Most people are afraid of going insane, and they think \u201cI\u2019m not crazy!\u201d when they\u2019re in my place: lost, alone, depressed, suicidal, and self injuring. But with me, I WANT to go crazy, I WANT to see/hear things that aren\u2019t there. The simple thought of being schizophrenic (which is my favorite mental disease) just makes me smile ear to ear. I love hospitals, and have this great desire to be in one. I want to be sick, and I know that\u2019s horrible, but I can\u2019t help it. I had a dream that I was in an ambulance, being raced to the hospital, and I woke up smiling. The thought of having problems is this huge thing for me. I get all sorts of books on mental illness and psychology. Just today I was thinking, \u201cAm I obsessed with going insane? But then does that make me insane already? Can I just not deal with the fact that I\u2019m sane? But then all these other symptoms I have, does that make me insane\u2026?\u201d",

        "Patient Question": "I\u2019m a 19 year old male who used to smoke pot when I was 15 here and again, and it never had an effect on me. 10 months ago I had my first panic attack out of no where and had an anxiety attack every night for 3 days. My mum was on vacation and it was just me and my girlfriend. After 2 days my conditioned worsened to the point where I was laying in bed shaking, afraid to leave the house, feeble and hazey. My neighbour took me to a doctor and he prescribed me with Citalopram. The first day I took it, I had a high of where I said \u2018oh my god I feel back to normal\u2019 for about an hour, then after; a low of where I was crying which faded out during the evening. I took my second tablet the next day of where the same thing happened but I decided to come off them. 10 months have passed and my anxiety is extremely at bay, however.. my brain feels re-wired. I feel (as the internet describes) depersonalized (DP/DR) it started off terrible being the only thing on my mind but now I don\u2019t think about it and I am able to live my life. However.. I still feel different, as if something has changed the way I feel and view reality. Although I can ignore it and get on with my life; I still feel like this \u2018not real feeling\u2019 is a black cloud that has improved but may not ever go away. Ever since that panic attack, reality hasn\u2019t seemed the same since and I always yearn to go back to when my life was.. \u2018normal\u2019. I know I\u2019m not crazy and I don\u2019t have thoughts of suicide, but a lot of the time I\u2019m wondering why I don\u2019t feel as happy as I should. I feel great after the gym and eating healthy sure; but constantly my mind is saying \u2018you feel great.. but not as great as you used to, there must be something you\u2019re not doing\u2019 what do you think has happened?

I want to have everybody know my name around the world and have celebrities come to my parties held at my massive palace estate. I want to be chased by paparazzi and I want to be on every talk show every weekend. I always want to be the center of attention. I want to own numerous companies that dominate the industry they sit in. I am willing to work as hard as I need to in order to obtain all of this. I have a 4.2 gpa with AP Classes, in addition to being multitalented in design, art, fashion, dancing, and more. This leads me to have a self-inflated image of myself where I consider myself to be more special and better than everyone else. I keep telling myself it is these traits that will lead to my fame and success. I am obsessed with success. If I do not achieve what I hope I will (fame, money, status, etc.) I will feel ashamed and feel like a complete failure. I will have failed my entire meaning to exist. I hate being under power. The only person I will ever love and accept being ruled by is God. I feel emotion, but not a lot of it. This pains me. When the closest person who I loved the most passed away, I had to force myself with all my might to muster a tear. I will forever hate myself for this. I wish I felt more emotion. I feel empathy for others but not as much as I know I should. All of this (everything I wrote above) every part of it makes me feel disgusting.

From another marriage my mom had my youngest bro who I was the main caregiver To when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and received treatment since it was 15 I cared for my special needs bro for 11 years doing all his personal care my life has revolved around him. My parents tended to be controlling of me cause of this. Always needing me home never allowing me to have independence without some sort of threat.

My mother told me I was a bad sister and that I wasn\u2019t allowed to see my brother whom I cared for. My stepdad refused to see me. And so I left.

I told him I had a severe form of Non-Verbal Learning Disability when I got diagnosed and that the reason I am somewhat okay socially is because my parents always over encouraged me to be social and one of my friends taught me how to talk to people \u201cnormally\u201d(and I\u2019d go to my parents with any social questions). He would tell me I seemed fine and I would tell him that part of it was my generalized anxiety making me stay more quiet and overthink and overthink until I figured out non-awkward or offensive things to say (esp. in a text). When I would bring this up, he would basically tell me to try harder because when we first dated (and I was on Abilify, an antipsychotic that actually can help autistics), I didn\u2019t act so different. Also during the relationship, he told me that he laughed during gore scenes in movies and had obsessive urges to harm people, but drowned it out with stories he told himself and video games. Now that we are broken up and he treats the relationship as if it were my fault for it ending and makes me do all the work to get him to talk to me, we have parted ways completely, and too often I have urges to harm him, mainly to show him the pain he caused me and my cause other, and also because he is entering the military with confidential computer data access which scares me. I\u2019m angry with myself for becoming like him, but he called me out of my mind once, and I had a psychiatrist that tried to convince me I was with practically no evidence. Granted I was histrionic in the relationship and easily anxious that he\u2019d break up with me when we had a really intense text fight involving all caps. He also accused me more than once of cheating when I never once cheated. Never agreed to call me as my therapist suggested us do for my NVLD.

        "Patient Question": "For nearly two years, I\u2019ve dealt with increasingly worse anxiety symptoms. The biggest issue is my inability to sleep when I am away from home, including difficulties sleeping in my own dorm. I\u2019ve dealt with these sleeping issues for over a year and generally find that when I can\u2019t sleep, my mind focuses on all the things wrong with the room I\u2019m in (too quiet, too hot, etc). I\u2019m also constantly going through a mental list of assignments, meetings, and events, and rewriting the list in my planner each day. Usually, I just run through the list in my head, but I have also noticed that I will speak out loud to myself while walking to and from class and run through the list while making a plan of what order to complete those tasks. I\u2019ll run through this order multiple times, typically until I get to wherever I\u2019m going or encounter other people because I\u2019m worried they will judge me for speaking to myself. Even when I\u2019ve accomplished the tasks I set out to do on a particular day, I still find myself thinking about the items on that list and panicking about how much more I have to do. As a result, I feel as if I can never fully relax. I\u2019m always worried that I\u2019m going to forget something on that list and that something bad will happen because I don\u2019t complete that particular thing. I also find that I have difficulty concentrating because I\u2019m constantly thinking about these things. When I have difficulty concentrating and feel really anxious about something, generally experiencing a heavy feeling in my chest and difficulty breathing, I end up picking at the skin around my nails, and on particularly bad days, I do this until they bleed. Although I generally fear that others will judge me for my actions, I find that picking helps me calm down and refocus myself. While my worries about school are generally my main focus, I often find myself worrying about my relationships as well, particularly that my friends don\u2019t really like me and that I don\u2019t actually have feelings for my boyfriend. I\u2019ve recently begun to fear that I have OCD rather than just anxiety. I\u2019ve brought some of these topics up to my doctor, but should I voice my worries that the anxiety I experience seems to mirror some aspects of OCD? (From the USA)",

        "Patient Question": "My first cousin has a problem. When she was a child, she heard an aunt say \u201ci can not imagine something moving inside of me\u201d and the other one was when the comedian Chelsea Handler said \u201cI don\u2019t think I would ever be able to carry the baby to full term, I would feel so \u201ctrapped\u201d. She repeats these 2 thoughts.Last year she was pregnant and miscarried because of the abnormalities and before she was referred to an abortion, the doctors told her \u201cYou can not get an abortion until the committee approves the diagnosis\u201d and she freaked out. She could not imagine being trapped with something inside of her without having the control to expel it or keep it or to do what she wanted. This thought was traumatic for her. She was pregnant 3 times. The first time she felt good/proud but her husband wanted an abortion.Later on they decided to have children but she had 2 miscarriages. First was early in pregnancy and the second one was at 4m. She was ok with it at 3,5m but then they told her something was wrong with the fetus and for her, even thought she later on cried and felt deep sorrow, she still felt relieved. Now that she is supposed to be doing ivf, she is afraid \u201cwhat if she changes her mind in the middle of the pregnancy?\u201d or \u201chow will she react when she feels first baby kicks, will she freak out?\u201d. Tried talking to a therapist but without success. She can not talk to her husband or anyone else bc all this is strange. She generally has low self-esteem. Her mother was not a warm person and never developed a relationship with her. She is 40 so she does have to do it soon. Ironically, she does want to have a child (her own) and says that she will be a great mother once the baby is \u201cout\u201d. She is a very nice, warm and rational person. She is preparing for the pregnancy now and freaking out. Not connecting to the idea of being pregnant in a way other women do. Generally doubtful of people (had a hard life, turbulent upbringing etc). Asked me recently \u201cwhat if I decide to terminate the pregnancy at 25 weeks, where can i go, where can i do it?\u201dTogether we searched the net, thinking maybe if I give her answers and security \u201cyou can control what to do with your body\u201d that this would calm her down and actually make her want the baby, and it did but only until week 22 or so. This is where her 25-week question comes from. Her biggest fear is of being pregnant. How can I help her calm down and go with pregnancy?",

        "Patient Question": "Hello! Since i was a kid i always had problems of making friends. I travelled a lot, went to summer camps in Europe, prestige ones, graduated a good university(bachelor degree). But i always had the same problem: at some point i was becoming a person no one paid interest to or even tried to ignore me. Sometimes it even turn to fights\u2026 When i turned 18 i have found a couple of very good friends and we were drinking every weekend. didnt pay attention to health issues and many times (about 10) drank till blacking out\u2026 couldnt control myself and felt completely happy while being drunk. I also was smoking marihuana for about half a year. Ive never had a girlfriend(not because i am an unattractive, but my behavior) . The second problem i face\u2013i cant concentrate at all. Since i was very young i have lost like 10 cell phones, credit cards, wallets, driver license, laptops. And i really hate myself for this. I tried many different sports(triathlon, half-marathon, boxing) for building precision, watched 100-s of TED talks, took some courses in coursera but seems like it getting worse and worse. Friends and family call me lazy,moony etc. While studying i distract every 5-7 minutes. To enter this question i spend like 3 hours. But sometimes feel very energetic, enthusiastic for a couple minutes. I jump, shout and feel like a champion. And i cant really predict this or control. Especially when i listen to the music. I stopped drinking alcohol for 3 month and do not plan to continue. I believed that i can start a new life and become a normal concentrated person within 3 month of writing down all my activities in my diary and analyze it weekly. To sum up 4 hours a day on average i spend in a \u201cfocused mode\u201d. But after 1 week of having a rest i returned to the previous version of mine. During these 3 month i cried a lot, punched myself in a face, tried to die while doing sports. Time goes faster and my mental power is reducing. I forget things more often and sleep more. In the period from 8 to 16 years old my daddy used to punish me physically and was shouting at me probably everyday. I really want to switch but seems like i cant find an appropriate tool for it by myself.",

I talk and imagine their answers in my head and then reply. I\u2019ve been okay with it but for the past year, it started to bother me because I realized I waste about 30% of my day on it. I low-key like it, because it gives me chances I was never given and probably will never be given. I imagine myself doing all the stuff I couldn\u2019t do. I started to feel really bad about it when I realized I don\u2019t fully move on from any single thing in my life (a past lover or something I failed in before) because of this. I basically never forget anything that happened to me because I keep repeating everything in my head and also make up scenarios that never happened. It\u2019s starting to get out of control because it makes me unable to focus, whenever I see a movie I keep pausing to talk for some time and then I go on with the movie and repeat, which ends up with me finishing a 2 hour movie in over 5 hours. I never felt bad about it but now I do because I came to know that\u2019s basically why I never move on. I repeatedly think about things that happened years ago. I\u2019ve had OCD since I was in grade 5 (about 8 years ago), I never fully recovered from it, it comes and goes. I don\u2019t know if it might be related.

        "Patient Question": "3 weeks ago, I went to my very first psychiatrist appointment. It was a pretty big milestone for me as I haven\u2019t been in contact with any mental health professional since I was 15, and I was really looking forward to finally getting the help I need. The whole experience was dissatisfactory overall, from filling out forms in the waiting room, to waiting for the doctor to actually come in for hours, I had switched from anxious but hopeful to frustrated and wishing I could just get it over with. Eventually, she (the psychiatrist) called me in and we talked for no more than 5 minutes. She asked me many questions but by the end she was completely dismissive about everything I confided in her about and ushered me out the door saying \u201cI am a psychiatrist, I deal with people who have REAL problems, which you do not have, just bad coping skills.\u201d Ah, yes, \u201cbad coping skills\u201d. I left with only one question in my mind: If I don\u2019t have any problems, what do you think those bad coping skills come from? To say I was upset upon my arrival at home would be a massive understatement. It took everything within me to not express my rage. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cut, I wanted to burn my entire house down even if it meant death to my whole family just so I could die in it \u2013 but that\u2019s not me. I hate bringing others into my personal problems. And so, I crashed into an extreme depressive episode in which I spent the evening crying for 7 hours, didn\u2019t get out of bed for days, didn\u2019t eat for more than a week (I\u2019m only recently starting to eat at least one meal a day) and spent every waking moment feeling like I need to jump off a bridge because even the thought of my own existence makes me feel incurably sick to the stomach and pained in the head. Currently, I\u2019m doing significantly better, and aim to contact a new therapist within the next week or so, but that initial experience is something I doubt I\u2019ll ever forget, but honestly, I just wonder what\u2019s the purpose of it all, as my desire for escape from existence runs its course, even when I\u2019m not in any way depressed at all.

I didn\u2019t think much of it at first, but eventually I kept talking to her more and more and seeing her around. We grew close quickly and for some reason I just felt connected to her. One day I received a text message from her as she had gotten my number off another student.",

        "Patient Question": "I\u2019m spiraling into this state of despair because I cannot enjoy what is around me. The birds, the trees, the sky, the smile of people, nothing. It brings no joy to me and it really bothers me. However, I understand that no human can live this wonderful life all of the time and be scott free without seeing some things that bother them. In my case, I\u2019ve seen some very horrible things, mostly car accidents and family members who have died from various diseases and being mortified and shocked at them having no life anymore. I\u2019m very sensitive to such things as well and it effects me more than anyone else I know and it bothers me. Even a dead deer on the side of the road traumatizes me for the day or seeing some zombies. One particular day, however, sealed the deal with me being pretty much traumatized constantly. So I\u2019m 13 years old and I\u2019m going to a doctor\u2019s appointment and I see an old man with his skull crushed in and the insides of his head splattered all over the highway from a Semi hitting him in his car. Imagine how mortified I was. I didn\u2019t speak for a whole day as a matter of fact and I cried the whole night. That perhaps sealed the deal with me being shocked. So fast forward to me being 20 now and I\u2019m upset that I can\u2019t be happy because I am in this constant state of shock and I do these thousand yard stares yet think and feel nothing because I\u2019ve seen what horrors the world has offered. I can\u2019t be happy at all. I ask God to help me but my mental capacity does not allocate me to register that there is innocence around me and that I should smile because my innocence and happiness has been permanently stolen from me and I am in a constant state of shock and I feel \u201cout of the world\u201d. Not like I\u2019m high, I just feel permanently detached from everything, which includes me happiness. I can still feel sadness which is unfortunate but I try to cope with it. To do this I\u2019ve grown very very attached to horses and I hug them to feel better, however this is temporary and I wish to be happy from my surroundings.",

It seems like a really bad habit, but now I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just a habit. I have a lot of interests. I like researching and finding out what I like, but that also happens to be a bad thing since when I find an interest and I decide to pursue it, after little time, I give up on it. I don\u2019t know why, but I always seem to do it. It\u2019s like I lose interest, or whatever motivation I had in the first place. For example, a couple of weeks ago I had decided to write a book. I\u2019ve always loved writing and reading, even when I was younger. Reading is certainly an addiction, while writing fills me with satisfaction. So I started creating the plot and organizing the story, because I wanted to do it perfectly. I started making summaries per chapter so that when I actually start to write, I know what goes on in the chapter. I was so pumped about it. I felt like this time, I was going to do it right. Until a few days ago. The book was just by the half. I stopped logging in my computer. I stopped looking for words. I stopped having interest. I simply stopped wanting to write. And I know that it\u2019s not writers block, because I knew what I had to write, I just didn\u2019t want to. And I\u2019m so annoyed about it, because I was telling myself at the beginning: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll totally make it through the end this time.\u201d And once again, I\u2019ve failed to complete it. And not just in writing, I also quit tap dancing, piano lessons, TV shows, you name it. And I\u2019m disgusted by this because I want to finish stuff, but then I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders, but I\u2019m pretty certain I have them. I\u2019ve never checked myself because my parents have enough troubles on their own. I have also insulin resistance and tachycardia (they are aware), so I don\u2019t want to trouble them with something as big as depression and anxiety that may just be all up in my head and possibly not be true.

        "Patient Question": "I have bipolar disorder, and I am a survivor of emotional abuse. I am finding that in recent years, it has become a trend for my coworkers to begin hating me to a point where it gets me fired. I try to be positive at work, I ask how my coworkers are doing, try to be personable and I make sure to say please and thank you if I ask for assistance in my tasks. Common problems I have found are if a coworker is disrespectful or offensive, I address it as soon as I can and not in front of others so they don\u2019t have to suffer public shaming. Often my coworkers will try to treat me like a doormat by having me do the majority of the work while they do almost nothing at all. If I say something, they\u2019ll hate me. If I don\u2019t say anything I continue to be a doormat. I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve missed learning some all important social skill that enables people to like me and treat me respectfully. I know it\u2019s very difficult to begin to gauge the problem from a brief paragraph on the internet, but if you have any advice, I would love to hear it. Thank you!",

        "Patient Question": "Been married about 10mth. We\u2019ve known each other 10 years, mostly not together as he is from overseas. He moved to the US and we got married recently. Seemed a bit homesick and perhaps depressed after a few months, but that\u2019s it. Recently he started not coming home. It started small. He was late from work or school, didn\u2019t text or respond to texts or calls. Then he just wouldn\u2019t come home until next day and wouldn\u2019t say or would just say be home late and ignore any follow-up question. After the first few times, he explained that he was bored or unhappy and it just built up until it was just exploding. I told him that he could spend time with friends but he should have respect for me and keep me updated. After that he proceeded to stay away for 5 days, texting me daily that he would be home that night. He even apologized and proceeded to stay away another two days. He eventually came home but now we are in another week+ period. There has been no real explanation other than saying he is having fun, just an unreliable person, he wants to make sure it is clear in his mind before he explains it, and it has to do with us. The behavior has been extremely cruel, not explaining what is wrong and just giving the silent treatment. I could never imagine doing that to someone I love. He has done similar things in past but were not living together \u2013 they involved silent treatment that lasted a week until I could get him to explain \u2013 usually some kind of perceived idea about how I will react to something. He does not really communicate his feelings. He does not take criticism well. He makes few decisions and procrastinates. He is always late. He shows no anger. I asked him to go to our PCP but told him just a checkup re potential depression. He agreed, came home and he went to do laundry and never came back \u2013 without a coat in cold, later texting he felt I was pushing/controlling him. He said the problem was us-me (no detail) and cancel the appt. We are now at the point where he says he loves and misses me but is not ready to come home. Any idea what could be causing this or how I can help?",

However, I feel like any second now someone will \u201cfind me out,\u201d and everyone will realize I am a fraud. In some sense I have always felt this way about myself: I was top of my class in high school, but all throughout felt entirely insecure in my intelligence and chalked it up solely to hard, sometimes obsessive, work ethic. I feel like ALL my successes have been due to an inordinate amount of work, not actual skill. I see others around me, especially now, who work hard, but don\u2019t have to work nearly as hard as I do to achieve better successes.

MDD also issue and of late have been disengaging and broke sobriety last session Drinkin prior to session yet we did an anger excer. I felt some release also felt it could be dangerous to do alone. I requested add., appt. from therapist since i had been in crisis. She had asked me if I wanted a referral. I was asking for an add., appointment. I wrote to her via email which I never do. expressed my feeling that it sounded as if she was again questioning if she wanted to work w me. I feel that what I wrote was true but also express anger (depression frustration w progress ) even thu I understand I feel I am Now faced with therapist uncertainty since as she put it unsure what works for me and if she is not meeting my needs will refer out. This I feel is more of her issue over what I wrote along with my break in sobriety . Today, she was late and if she was running late in the past she w tex me as a curisity. When she arrived 10min late having no apology. Then she indicated she had 10min to finish up her lunch. After 15min waved her hand to proceed to her office. In procession she was in in an small area hidden out of site were the copier was I saw her and she said go on in. She came in shortly afterward and stated she was going to make a copy of the emails i sent to her this took yet another 5min. while in session I discussed up dates and my feeling of over the past several days and my feeling of progress. She also advised me we would review the emails i sent. She told me in no uncertain terms she would not give me any additional time until we come to some idea on how to work together. she cut the session short after her being late and gave an extra 15min wait time prior to visit. the entire interview was 35mins . She was finished even giving a honest attempt to discuss matters opened her door for me to leave turned her back on me she indicated she has scheduled me for the month of Sept., yet I have paid to be within a journal group which last thru sept. As I began to leave her office she also turned around to leave. I allowed her to understand that I felt her distaste of me and her attitute toward me requesting her to drop such . she reminded me that the session was over went into bath with door open turned around again with the same look of distaste on her face, she then smerked as she closed the door. Unfinished business and I feel termination is going to happen not that there is anyone else who will treatment me that specializing in tramua treatment to the extent that she has been and continues to train in. I again mentioned as I did in email has we walked down the hall if you do not want to treat me just say so. She and I have had diff in past just about a year ago when I called a break she took it as a termination. Yet accepted me back 3months later only to advise me of referrals both of which have been cited for breeches and disaplined with the Off., of Pro dis. she is aware of it . I fully understand that i wish to heal and i also respect her abilities however I feel again she is in decision making to terminate me. She knows me and I feel and expressed to her that this isnt just about me she did acknowledge it. As last week it was apparent she needed affirmation from me that the anger work was useful. But I informed her that I wa not sure if I would be able to do this excercise safely fearful i would get more sucked in and not be able to get out therefore lashing out on others . she understood that I believe as she eluded to affirm my decision as wise mind. I also stated yes and self awareness. Not acknowledged. she feels insulted and so do I I can get over it but she has again seems uninterested to treat even thu further appts scheduled. I asked her to lose her attitute toward me and that last wks session i felt became about her since she was not able to accept my affirmation of the theraptic session. I have been deeply depressed anger is real. I want to heal yet I do not have the reason to believe that she is willing. Now I want for next week to awaiting any if any discussion of our relationship which she has allowed me full understanding until we come to an agreement on what and how we work together are in place. I lack faith that she will to be resonable and I pushed her buttons apparently today. ended the session after 35min. What is ure thoughts. I feel her lack of desire to fully engage in any discussion. The facts of her rudeness toward me and yes I responded in rudeness and I regret it. She was willing to make a referal last week which confused me since I just wanted an additional appt. Games being Played on me? I just feel so defeated and vunerable as she what believe is in processes of searching for some other person to treat me. and I cannot will not begin again. I cannot. No resolve just hostility toward me and back at her. I have allowed her to know I see and her her anger toward me yet she says nothing and makes decisions to further destroy the relationship Thoughts plz.",

        "Patient Question": "I would not consider this an \u201cissue.\u201d However I am curious to understand the potential reasoning\u2019s behind this. Usually I spend a great majority of my free time in solitude, I don\u2019t bother having social interactions with others (family or acquaintances) because quite frankly it is not enjoyable or particularly interesting. As far as intimacy goes I absolutely disdain love and affection. My childhood was great, and I do not have any family issues currently or from the past. I simply find that love and affection disgusts me. I realized that when I was 12, my mother would shower me with love and it would completely irritate me and grind my gears. She knows now that I do not like that so she stopped. The issue however, is my lack of any emotion and care for others. I am an introvert, but most introverts have some kind of social interactions with close friends or acquaintances. I however don\u2019t have friends since most people cant meet my expectations and when I am friendly to someone they associate that with interest and they start to become annoying and wanting to have a conversation. I usually show them I am uninterested by replying with single words or expressing no emotion on my face until its awkward and they say goodbye. I cant connect with people at all on an emotional level is what I realized I don\u2019t care about the persons dreams, desires, emotions or well-being for that matter. This may come across as very blunt and rude. But I don\u2019t even care about my parents in the same manor I don\u2019t care about other people. I don\u2019t mind socializing so long as there is a clear goal (work or educational space). I don\u2019t enjoy communicating with people for enjoyment. My lack of intimacy is probably a direct result of my disinterest with socializing with people. That being said feedback on this would be much appreciated.",

I was devastated because I never ever thought something like this could happen. He has moved out now, and has promised to go to counseling. My question is if families are able to come back from something like this or not, and also, if he gets help and apologized to her and I make sure all precautions are in place so this never happens again, if it\u2019s horrible for me to expect her to be ok with letting him move back in. We have two sons together and I want our family to stay intact. He is an incredible person and provider. He has been very depressed since the passing of his father. He admitted to it and cried for a whole week because he feels so horrible for what he has done. I know on he inside he is a good person. I\u2019m just blown away that this happened. I want to protect my daughter above all else. I\u2019ve told him if he moves back in and anything like this happened again I would report it and he would lose his kids. He swears it was just a glitch and he was just depressed and he is very, very sorry for it and he would never do it again. He did not ever touch her, and when he asked that of her she said no, so he didn\u2019t see her at all. It was mostly just words but I know words can be the most hurtful. I really just want to know if you think it\u2019s possible for us to keep our family together if everyone gets some therapy and help. Thank you for your time!",

I\u2019m too young to be worrying about my life the way I do. i have a very good body image and I try to keep it that way as best as i can. a little too much. I believe I suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Dissorder. I havent really been able to admit it to myself or anyone around me. I believe I\u2019ve had it for maybe two years or so, but its gotten worse over time. It starts with waking up. If i dont sit up a certain way that doesnt make me comfortanle, I lay back down. I go down stairs to eat my breakfast. if i dont see something i like on TV i have to blink 10 times or until im confortable to get the image out of my mind. in school, i cant sit on chairs without whiping it off 5 times because if i dont, i think ill get fat. i can\u2019t touch doorknobs because im afraid ill get sick from the germs. If i smell something bad, or something i dont like, i have to \u201cpush out\u201d the bad scent out of my nose three times and breathe in \u201cgood smells\u201d once or twice. My friends notice that I\u2019ve been acting strange but i usually cover it up by saying like my nose itches or there were crumbs on the seat. Its really hard for me to live with and i am soo frustrated from it. Im only a sophmore in High School. I should be worrying about school. i strongly think my grades are suffering from it too. i Already see a therapist because my mom thinks im have anger problems. but i can never bring up the guts to tell her about my suffering. What im asking is to know that I\u2019m not the only one whos going threw this or if I\u2019ve diagnosed myself correctly. Ive researched it and all signs point to OCD. But i also am angry all the time towards my mother. she grosses me out but i cant control it. when im around her my \u2018habits\u2019 act up. but theyre more like natural reactions than habits. I dont know if medication will help with these problems or if i need sleep or if its stress. I really need some advice because i hate living like this. Am I going crazy? (life at home) My mom some times goes a little crazy or acts stranger than usual. she yells at me than apologizes. it gives me whipelash. i know she sees a therapist and i just hope that craziness isnt heretitary. can living with someone make you sick of them? even if their your own mother? and my father is an alcholic. but he has been 7 months sober. i am the middle child and i get along fine with my siblings. although my brother often gets annoyed with me because of my breathing habits. they annoy him. I also have severe headaches. Sometimes they give me excrutiating pains and sometimes they are dull. I also feel depressed and sad all the time. I try to act happy when im around my friends but i want to feel truely happy. Im usually in my room all day after school breathing in and out in certain ways, trying to reset the \u201cbad germs\u201d that i have breathed in. (im sorry if ive confused you). I had a concussion in the past but im not sure if ive fully healed, or its all in my head. i get weird head aches in the front of my mind when im doing my rituals and it throws off my day. sometimes i dont feel like im in my body/mind. i feel like im always tired and i feel like im always asleep. and i dont feel my emotions to the fullest. sometimes i dont feel any emotions. its hard to explain. but i just need some advice. Im handeling this all on my own and Im not sure WHAT to do. i keep a journal of everything that goes on and it makes me more depressed. im not sure if you know what im asking or not. but please help me if you can!",

He currently travels for work to another state Monday-Thursday every week. I am his first serious girlfriend and the only girlfriend he\u2019s introduced to his parents (that don\u2019t even live in the same state as we do). Throughout our 6-month relationship he has taken many steps to show how committed he is to me. For example, when I had received an interview for school in Colorado, he began interviewing for jobs there. For the past couple months, he\u2019s been looking for jobs back in the city that we live in. Despite all the great things he\u2019s done, and despite how much I know he loves me, I have severe trust/jealously issues. My last boyfriend had lied to me and was dating a \u201cfriend\u201d while he was dating me. My first love whom I dated for 2.5 years broke up with me because he developed feelings for someone else. Needless to say, I let past experiences and my insecurities get the best of me in my current relationship. I have gotten jealous about his female friends and have admittedly over-reacted many times. However, I have had (what I fear) legitimate reasons to be concerned about his new friendship with a female coworker. Like I said he works out of state during the week. On the phone one night, he mentioned he met a girl at work who\u2019s parents live where his parents live and that she invited him to get together for drinks with her and her brother during Christmas. Fast forward to Christmas, after not responding to my text for hours, he tells me he and his sister were having drinks and playing games at his coworker\u2019s parents house. I got very upset and asked if they had hung out before. He admitted that they spent two hours together ALONE on the beach two days prior. I was distraught and did not speak to him until the next day. He insists they are just friends and I have nothing to worry about. I let it go until I recently saw that they became friends on Facebook. I again got very upset with him and expressed how much it bothered me. He was hurt that I didn\u2019t trust him despite saying time and time again that I had nothing to worry about and that she was just a friend. He isn\u2019t friends with anyone else on Facebook from work other than her and he even works with a guy that went to the same college as him. To me, this situation does not seem right. As I have told him, I fear he has developed feelings for this person and doesn\u2019t want to admit it to himself, let alone me. I don\u2019t want to be with someone who has feelings for someone else and I wish he would just admit it to me if that\u2019s the case. My question is: Am I letting my extreme jealous nature get the best of me and I need to learn to take my boyfriend at his word? Or do I need to interpret my feelings as instinct and walk away from the relationship?",

The decision was the result of his persistent efforts to help me at working every situation (we were in the same college and office too). Though he is not good at looks, a silent type of guy(unlike me), I considered him for hope for his improved life because of me,his nice family(As he told) and his nature. In the beginning, things were awesome, we used to roam across the city, visit temples, and be happy wherever we would go. But since 2-3 months, I began to feel, things have turned dull, because after knowing each other, we have nothing to discuss, sometimes, he doesn\u2019t say a single work for minutes on phone. And when I complain, he says that silence speaks more than words, and he is happy with me. But this dullness and boredom made me depressed many times, specially the fact that he is suffering from many illnesses like dryness, obesity, very poor eyesight which I thought he would be enthusiastic to cure for me,but he didn\u2019t try to make the things normal for me either. I was even worried to find his hair slowly falling out.All the day, I would keep worrying about all these problems, which would give me butterflies. Once I even felt bad when I found him giving more importance to his friends and telling me that it\u2019s because I keep complaining to him about everything, he feels alone, and then he looks for friends. this made me feel even worse specially when he doesn\u2019t call me when he is with them. Finally, time came when I told my parents about him. I called him home. My parents accepted him only for me, but also complained about his too silent nature, because sometimes, you need to speak.",

        "Patient Question": "I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend for 14 months now. During our relationship we\u2019ve been back and forth a lot, mainly because it\u2019s his first relationship (even though he\u2019s in his late 20\u2019s) and had a lot of insecurities. He broke it off once with me because we had been fighting a lot, mainly because I created arguments because I didn\u2019t feel like he was in the relationship like he was supposed to be. He told me he wasn\u2019t 100% sure that he was in love, and he said that he wasn\u2019t whole heartedly in the relationship anymore. 3 weeks after we broke up he came back and said that he was sure about how he felt about me, and that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me because he was miserable when we were apart. Since then we\u2019ve had a good relationship up until recently. He lost his job and is very stressed out and nervous because of it. He is always moody, snaps easily, and has no understanding for my wanting to talk things out and be understood when arguments come up. When I try to peace things out in a caring and loving manner he gets angry and says that he hates how we have to drag things out all the time. I try to explain to him that I want reassurance that he really wants to be here this time and the conversations become longer because I\u2019m waiting to hear something reassuring from him while all he does it get angry and try to brush me off. He tells me he wants me to be his wife one day, that he wants to have a family with me and that he\u2019s in love with me, yet I don\u2019t feel it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just from his moods or not, but I am scared that he is only saying this because he\u2019s afraid to hurt me again. When he is in a good mood he is more loving and caring, but that almost never happens anymore. When he got angry yesterday he said that our arguments makes him doubt whether he wants to do this for the rest of his life, and it broke my heart. Should I leave him be when he gets in his moods or am I right in wanting to be reassured without having him get mad?",

He pushed me against the kitchen counter and put his hands around my neck and his kids were there (I helped take care of them since they were babies, no kidding) since the kids saw it and were crying I felt like it was all my fault, so I went on my knees and asked for forgiveness. After that happened, my Mom decided I should still live in the same house despite him laughing while apologizing to me (since he did tried to stop my breathing). Present now something like almost happened I was just giving my opinion on how to clean meat is all and he deliberately ignores me, when I ask why he just says to keep him from getting mad, I ask him why I didn\u2019t do or say anything. But that day he was mad about anything I noticed so I told that he was (as he put it in every situation I get a little annoyed by) needing a midol. And the scene minus him choking me happened again but was stopped by my Mom and sister and he mocked me by and I quote \u201cI\u2019ll do the (my name) and he yelled afterwards towards everyone. In the end we went back to the house and until now I refuse to eat what he makes or buys because if I do eat I feel like puking and disgusted and I know people would die for that food but I just say I don\u2019t want any. I just literately hate my family except my Mom (she\u2019s my Mom) my younger sister and my younger nieces.

        "Patient Question": "I know the site has many articles on this but I feel like it may be different somehow. I have had homicidal thoughts from a young age, I am 14 now, but just about two months ago they started to become very common and sometimes intrusive, or at least more than before. I was hospitalized for suicide attempts and excessive self-harm in March so some people think this may be the cause of it. These thoughts are not disturbing to me, rather I enjoy them. I think of things like abusing people, what it would be like to drive something through someone\u2019s skin, watching people bleed or beg. I have also been just grabbing different things when I am alone that seem sharp and just driving them into whatever material is near me. It gives me an adrenaline rush similar to what I would experience whilst self-harming. I believe it could be due to withdrawal from self-harm so these thoughts are sort of like a substitute, but I might just be lying to myself. I have always experienced this but I thought it was something everyone had until recently so this makes me think that it might be less than what I am making it out to be for some reason. I feel as if I am lying to myself and I am only telling myself that I am homicidal just because. I do not trust others and I do not trust myself so a lot of the time I feel as if I am not mentally ill and only making it up. My therapist tells me this is not the case but I continue thinking I am only making things up. So I am conflicted as to whether these thoughts are real or not and I am just acting like it. When I was younger I used to only think about killing specific people, but it can be anyone now. Anyone that causes me the slightest bit of anger, my closest friends, my family (especially my mom, I have wanted her to die or for me to kill her since elementary), animals, teachers, or even strangers.

        "Patient Question": "I\u2019m a 18-year-old woman, and when I was 13 years old, I killed my family\u2019s pit-bull puppy. His name was Poppy. I killed him by tying a rope to his collar and than putting in over a large branch on a tree which had a hunting post on it. I got up onto the hunting post, grabbed a hold of the rope, and then began pulling the rope down. As I pulled the rope down, Poppy was lifted up in the air. My hands were shaking while i did the deed; and I watched as his body shacked ferociously until, finally, I heard his neck snap. I then got down from the hunting post, untied the rope from his collar, put his leash on his collar, and grabbed a hold of the leash while dragging him through the woods. I put his body underneath some bushes. I left the body there for about a month and then went back to the site, and all that was left was bones (it was summer). I kept going back to the spot almost everyday, and then I took his canine teeth from his skull and put them in my room. Not too long after I did this, I took his head and put it on a tree branch. I then brought my sister into the wood, showed her the head, and told her it was a coyote\u2019s head; I constantly fantasize about killing and torturing animals and sometimes animals.

However they are not spontaneous..usually (90% or more of the time) they are caused by me being paranoid and possessive of my boyfriend. I trust him and he has never done anything to make me feel otherwise; but I still feel like I can\u2019t let my guard down. For example, I could go from being in an ecstatic mood and be on top of the world and a chick could talk to him about homework or how to contact him ; anything and I\u2019d automatically get in a rut. On top of this, I feel like I consistently need to be paid attention to by people close to me, but I hate being in the spotlight! I like being alone most of the time and prefer everyone to keep their distance from me yet I feel like I need some sort of praise from him, my family, my *close* friends. It\u2019s getting kind of hard to deal with because when I get in the \u201cempty\u201d state of mind I feel unmotivated and end up neglecting school work, chores, activities, everything. I feel like it is not worth the trouble of dealing with and this just drives me deeper in since the lack of work ethic makes the future even harder to deal with. I constantly worry of the future and these mood swings are messing with my life. I just want something to go by \u2013 some advice for what could even kind of help. Anything.

Although it\u2019s been going on since I was about eleven at least, that\u2019s when I had my first major panic attack. I\u2019ve tried a number of anti-depressants to treat my depression and anxiety, but they either didn\u2019t work or the side affects were to severe. So now she put me on a \u201clife style change\u201d, where I am supposed to sleep more and exercise. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. My depression and anxiety have been so bad in the last six months I nearly throw up every morning from stress. I cannot seem to get out of bed, the very thought of facing the world every day makes me cry and debate my life. Furthermore, I cannot seem to sleep more than 4 hours, even with the melitonin my doctor prescribed me. My sleep deprivation has caused me to go into hysterics from crying and to laughing more than a few times. I\u2019ve lost all interest in any activities I used to do in the past four years. I once danced, I quite that too now. I feel so emotionally disconnected from everyone. My family and friends notice it as well. Usually they\u2019ll make fun of me or show real concern. Furthermore I wish I didn\u2019t have the two friends I have. It\u2019s stressful, I never do anything with them no matter how much they want me to. I feel like I\u2019ll either be a bother or I just don\u2019t want to do anything. I used to be an A grade student, I\u2019d overload myself with advanced classes, now I\u2019ve failed out of three of them. I just don\u2019t see the point anymore. I hate myself. I cannot function in any social situation and now I can\u2019t even seem to do any simple task anymore. Not to mention my weight changes, I\u2019d go from binge eating to nearly starving myself because I just wasn\u2019t hungry any more. It was so extreme for a few months, my weight got to a high of 135 pounds to a low of 117. In a week I lost ten pounds. Quite frankly I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019ve used support sites and they don\u2019t seem to help. I feel like I\u2019ve extended all my resources.",

She does this with all my siblings too, though. I have three younger siblings as well and no matter what they do she will defend them in every way, if one calls me a bad name, she will say they are going through something. Anyways, my brother is a year and a half older than me, he has had a few health problems in the past and my mother has really flocked to his side since then. (it\u2019s obviously not his fault, I usually get along with him and I do love him.) He has recently started University which was really hard for my mom to deal with, he started the process last year and every step of the way she wanted to know how it was going with him and supported him whenever he was doubting himself. I have a lot of the same problems and struggles he went through, when I start to talk about University and how I\u2019m stressed and worried about applying to my mom she just says \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine.\u201d Or \u201cDon\u2019t worry so much.\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem to really want to know how i\u2019m doing or how i\u2019m feeling.

I felt awful and had felt awful for a very long time, but after getting on medications and feeling like a normal, happy person for a couple years, it all felt like an old unreal dream. So I decided to stop my medications. My doctors advised me against it, saying that if I had suffered more than 3 episodes, I should stay on medication indefinitely, but I had never \u201ccounted\u201d my episodes. Really, it just felt like I was born with one long and nasty episode. I have been off my meds for a month now and I feel horrible. My anxiety is so bad that my whole body hurts from being so tense and shaky. I\u2019m missing work either because I\u2019m too busy crying or I just don\u2019t want to deal with life. I feel lonely, sad, and hopeless. I feel like I am cursed for life. From what I have read and heard, depression occurs in episodes. But I feel like I am doomed to feel like this forever, having no respite unless I take high doses of medications. Is it possible that I just have a \u201clifetime long episode\u201d? I only went to see a psychiatrist when I was 22, about a year after I moved out of my parents house. My parents are deniers of mental illness \u2013 the have a \u201cpick yourself up by your bootstraps\u201d / \u201cyou can\u2019t possibly have depression\u201d attitudes, so I always attributed my poor mental status to a character flaw. But when I reflect on my childhood and adolescence, I don\u2019t ever remember being happy. I think I was always depressed. I cannot possibly live my life feeling this depressed but I don\u2019t want to take medication for the rest of my life either. I haven\u2019t even mentioned that my medications and behavioral therapies have done absolutely nothing to help my OCD. That I have heard can last a lifetime. I don\u2019t think I can live like this. It\u2019s getting to be too much. It can all be tolerated until you realize that, for the rest of your existence, none of this will go away.",

He is a realist, recovering alcohol of 25 yrs, does not believe in Western Medicine and speaks the truth about everything regardless of feelings. We have had challenges from day one but the most recent challenge is that he has enacted stipulations that we will not attend public events together, we will not eat at restaurants together, we will not attend a movie together, etc \u2013 all because he believes I am unable to control my behavior/emotions. For example, we attended an event in which I ran into a male who had caused a serious injury to myself in which I almost lost a leg. I have not seen this male since the final court date.The male dragged out things out for years causing me more money and frustration to collect on his criminal restitution. Yes, I was surprised to see him at the event, told my bf who the male was and expressed disgust of seeing him again. I did not approach the male or speak to him. The whole incident/my behavior last possibly 5 mins before I collected myself and went back to having a good time. Since that event, my bf believes I have anger issues and can not be trusted to \u201cstay in the moment\u201d with him therefore he will not attend any more events with me because he \u201cwill not put himself\u201d in that situation again. Nothing I did or said should have affected my bf therefore I am confused to say the least. He explained it as why should he feel uncomfortable or give support to me for something I should have dealt with already. He does not want to go to the movies because I once mentioned I was uncomfortable in the seats however we have since gone to two movies with the new seating and I have been fine. He knows that but for some reason has decided all of sudden to issue this stipulation. I believe this is controlling manipulative behavior, possibly passive aggressive and punishment for things I may have done or said that he will not forgive me for. I do not believe this is normal but he has me almost convinced I am at fault for these stipulations. Please help me understand what is going on. (From the USA)",

Everyday i have to do these counting and moving rituals although some days are worse than others. Some days i have no control but some days i have more control over them.

For example when i am going to be I always have a certain pattern that can take quite long. I can also get quite distressed if i do not do these rituals. These reasons i am saying this and not looking at other, already answered questions is that it is very area based. I only get the moving and organizing rituals at my house. Anywhere else and I do not get them. Even the counting rituals are not as bad. But when i get home they suddenly all come back. I am speaking about it now as i used to just think that i was just an organized person but i am thinking now that because i have little control over my obsessions that it may be OCD.

I also highly value his opinion and advice, and I trust him a lot for some reason.

        "Patient Question": "Hello. I developed a crush on a celebrity when I was 10 and it has grown into an obsession that I can\u2019t stop (I\u2019m 23 now). I\u2019ve been diagnosed with generalised anxiety and have had depression in the past linked to poor self-image/esteem. My family relationships are good. I\u2019ve had two relationships, one when 13 and the second when 15. The first time I was used by him and for 3 years until I got over him, whenever he was dating someone I would try hard to look like them (hair/makeup/clothes etc.). The second was emotionally abusive but I broke-up after a month and never wanted to reconcile. I thought about this celebrity less while in relationships but never fully stopped. Since my teen years I\u2019ve fantasised about them: being in a relationship, conversing with them, being intimate (sexually) etc. When in a relationship with another female celebrity I became obsessed with her and still am, saving hundreds of pictures of her, watching all the interviews I could because I wanted to act, sound and look like her, eat, exercise and use the same beauty products as her if I could find that information. Whenever seeing pictures of them I feel a painful pit in my stomach. I would follow pages on instagram that followed them. After they broke up I stayed obsessed, less than initially but still, focusing more on whoever he\u2019s currently with/dating (he\u2019s with a regular girl now). I\u2019ve tried to pursue his interests (e.g. art and watch the same TV shows) and also more recently tried to even use the same products and dress the same way he does if I can find that info (But I don\u2019t want to be a man). I\u2019m seeing a clinical psych and she said she\u2019s unsure and to just avoid checking their social media (tried many times and even after over a month of abstaining from all social media it never worked). I\u2019ve tried journaling, meditating, talking to friends and some things help a little but not much. I can barely differentiate what I like and what him/his girlfriends like. I can\u2019t concentrate for a few minutes without them popping in my head even when I don\u2019t want them to. Avoiding doesn\u2019t help and I don\u2019t want to, nor replace it by forcing myself in a relationship. I want to confront it so I never have the issue again.",

My husband has ocd, ADHD, and a mild form of turrets. He doesn\u2019t like wetness (no wet kisses, absolutely zero desire to have anything to do with a vagina). He\u2019s a butt liking guy. He seems to be put off by sex itself as he wants to converse the entire time about my thong and sometimes even pretending to have one of us get shot or stabbed in the belly. Nothing can be mentioned about sex. It\u2019s all about the thong, and scenarios of getting stabbed or shot. He can\u2019t keep an erection without this. It\u2019s so unfulfilling for me as I only have my imagination that he\u2019s being normal, passionate and enjoying all of me in bed. For me to get anywhere myself, I need this imagination and certain maneuvers for stimulation. When he requires constant talking from me, I can\u2019t even have that. (Though he gets upset if I don\u2019t climax first. This gentleman way of letting the girl go first is sweet, but he doesn\u2019t help in any way other than thrusting. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it, it\u2019s like asking a favor that he can\u2019t stand doing, which kills it.) I don\u2019t know why he is so put off by sex and my female parts. I know it\u2019s not me. I know that I am fun, kinky, clean and full of passion.

In the morning I am supposed to make sure he gets breakfast and I can\u2019t even knock and then go into his room without him yelling get out and calling me stupid or something. A behavior specialist told us to have him write 10 sentences if he is rude or does not follow directions. One time he yelled at me so I told him to write his sentences, but he said he only wanted to write 5. My mom has told me that if we do not follow through on this his behavior will just get worse, especially if I let him do what he wanted and only write 5 sentences. My dad was right there and didn\u2019t want to hear my brother argue, so he said he could do 5. I got upset because its frustrating having to do deal with my brother\u2019s bad behavior a lot. I went into my room and my dad came in and got within like 2 inches of my face and started screaming at me about how I needed to listen to him and stuff. I was scared because I actually thought he might hit me, but he didn\u2019t. Ever since I was little my parents would yell and argue with each other all the time. Now they barely talk and don\u2019t sleep in the same room and now my mom is cheating on my dad.

I lost him to a stroke as well as a long-term sickness from diabetes and kidney failure. I went through a deep long bereavement as well as my inhumane thoughts. They would make fun of me and my dead dad, calling me an n%$#r and showing me disgusting images. During that period, I attempted suicide three times. Right now, I feel so hopeless and pessimistic. I don\u2019t believe things will get any better any time soon and I\u2019m convinced that life will get progressively worse from here now on. I believe that the evil in this world triumphs any good people will try to harness. I feel like I\u2019m just mentally dragging myself day by day to only fulfill the needs of my peers and teachers. I really despise going to High school, and I\u2019m only a Freshman! There is no passion in my school nor in my life.

At least when I was suicidal I felt something, like, pain and worthlessness. I also miss being depressed. It was like my own little shell that I can keep. It was my safety blanket. No, it was my identity.

We are a good family, I am my parents only child and 3 years ago we have moved countries, from Brazil to the United States. For the past 5 years, me and my dad have questioned if she has any type of mental disorder. She is very stubborn, violent when mad, and very easily irritated. Her mood changes incredibly easy, for example today- which was the last drop for me- After my last few days of school, I came home early to study for an important exam tomorrow, however as I know she feels lonely I decided to stay with her for a few hours. We had great three hours together, laughing and talking. Finally, I need to leave and she asks me to drive her somewhere close, \u201cJust wait for me to get ready\u201d. I should mention she had to be with friends in few minutes and, she constantly complains she is lonely so I did my best to insist she\u2019d go. Once I walk into her room 20 minutes after, she is laying in her bed, practically naked on her phone ( that is another issue, my mother is completely addicted to her phone and she blames me and my father for excluding her for so long she has to stay on her phone). To finish, I told her to hurry up because I didn\u2019t have that much time, given I had spent the past 3 hours with her, and she stormed calling me names and saying I give her 1% of my time sometimes, and when I do I am not even paying attention.",

I had been living elsewhere with a completely different lifestyle. Due to financial issues I had been forced to move to my hometown with my family but without my father. During my first year here I had been severely depressed. At times I was highly tempted to cut my arms or simply climb up to the roof and jump but luckily I refused to do either. During this time I refused to speak to anyone and I had noticeably started spending more time with my online \u2018friends\u2019. This continued on for several months and when school had started it seemingly got worse. I had made one friend during my first year, and if it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that she had also been in a somewhat similar situation I would have never spoken to her.",

I\u2019ve been thinking about self-harm even though I\u2019ve always found it ridiculous, and my mental breakdowns have been occurring more and more often. I\u2019m more prone to crying out of nowhere or at the slightest mention of something even remotely upsetting to me. I\u2019ve been in two relationships and both of them were terrible, one partner forcing me into sexual activities, and one partner leaving me for someone else while blaming me for the relationship failing. My mom has been switching between being nice to me, ridiculing me, and ignoring me. It makes my already low self-esteem drop even more, and at this point, I\u2019ve learned to ignore her, but It\u2019s still difficult sometimes to tone out her words. My teacher at school doesn\u2019t teach the material but expects us to know how to do it on his level even though we\u2019re beginners (AP Language). He gives everyone bad grades all the time and never praises us when we do good. His lectures to the class are no better than saying we all are terrible students and should be receiving even lower grades. He makes me feel unwanted and going to his class makes me really anxious. I\u2019m currently trying to drop it, but my principal won\u2019t return my emails regarding it. I want to get help, but the other part of me feels like I don\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019ve been surprising myself when it comes to controlling the urges to harm myself or worse, but the urges have been getting more tempting as of late. I haven\u2019t really been feeling any positive emotions lately, but whenever other people are around I subconsciously smile, even when I don\u2019t want to.

I started having anxiety when my girlfriend (soon to be wife) got pregnant while we were in high school. I finally broke down and asked my mom for help and we went and seen a psychologist. He told me all i had was anxiety and no disorder. I have noticed that I obsess with things. When i was younger i use to have a fear of hiv/aids. (i was not educated on it very well is why i figure i had a fear of it). I have noticed i obsess with 1 topic for a few months then once i start getting anxiety again from life i swap subjects maybe for a relief of some kind? (For instance for a few months ill be really into fishing and want to know all the best stuff then ill swap to trucks and ect.) This causes me no distress really. My distress comes from when i start getting scared im going schizo. This is the only mental illness that i really obsess over. There is no mental in my family except my mom which has depression. I obsess over it so much ill think i hear voices. It says what im feeling deep down like the one of the times i was thinking about a dirtbike and was obsessing over the parts and what id do to it kind of zoning everything out. Then my own voice when i was very concentrated on thinking about it while walking at work poped in my head almost like instant words said \u201ccan you even ride good\u201d. This scared me and cause alot of anxiety and still does when i think about it. I Knew it was my innervoice but i felt like i lost control and my mind blurted out without me doing it. Ive never had a person that wasn\u2019t there speaking to me, or hear whispers. Just that i feel like i get so zoned out in something else that i mistake my subconscious thinking into hearing voice. (My own voice not someone elses. I dont feel like thoughts are being placed in my head or supernatural stuff). This has only happened once or twice when im really obsessing over something.",

And I am sick of being lumped in with opioid addicts. Addicts made a choice to abuse drugs. Depression, PTSD, are NOT a choice. Plus I am sick of illegals, minorities, & special interests getting to do and say what ever they want, and of them getting a free ride while I work my butt off only to have what I earn taken from me & given to those freeloaders. Obamacare has allowed our private medical data to be expolited for profit; see the FICO medication adherence score for example). I have corporate health insurance but it now costs $10,000 out of pocket per year & only covers the same crappy providers that medicaid welfare freeloaders can access. The toxic left and Congress destroyed US healthcare via obama. Now the cures act ensures humans are the medical device guinea pigs instead of the former FDA 2-animal model/clinical trial model. Grneric meds are literally toxic and inferior worh side effect profiles that are horrific \u2013 cheap meds are useless. Moreover, the quality of the fake providers (non-MDs) that is the new standard in the \u201cvalue-based\u201d hellcare industry is nothing but a sick joke. This is why I dont want to wake up tomorrow- where is the hope for any quality of life in the future? This is America. And as the former spouse of a legal immigrant, where is this Nation headed when Citizens are treated like trash?",

        "Patient Question": "My mother-in-law is best friends with my husband\u2019s ex, who he has known since he was little and dated after high school for like 2 years. We have been married for 7 years and it has been an issue. His mom treats her like her daughter and because of this I distance myself from her. The ex tried to separate us several times and even married my husband\u2019s friend. She got pregnant last years and miscarried and tried to reach out to my husband for support. My mother-in-law talks about her to me all the time with no sympathy even though my husband and I have said things to her. In a few years my husband and I want to build a house and have my mother-in-law move in for financial reasons and because she is an older lady. But I know she will want the ex to come over and she will say she helped pay for the house so she can have whoever she wants over. Although my husband understands why I am upset, he and his mom both say I have issues and need to grow up. I am at a loss of what to do. Do I just get over it and if they have an affair I get a divorce? Or do I get over it and trust my husband that she is an ex and he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her? I am a jealous person and I have trust issues. I love my husband but I feel like my mother-in-law needs to respect my feelings after many conversations (ending it she will talk to who she wants and I need to grow up and I have issues). The ex has no concern over my feelings because I have confronted her multiple times about it. I am at a loss.",

I was devastated because I never ever thought something like this could happen. He has moved out now, and has promised to go to counseling. My question is if families are able to come back from something like this or not, and also, if he gets help and apologized to her and I make sure all precautions are in place so this never happens again, if it\u2019s horrible for me to expect her to be ok with letting him move back in. We have two sons together and I want our family to stay intact. He is an incredible person and provider. He has been very depressed since the passing of his father. He admitted to it and cried for a whole week because he feels so horrible for what he has done. I know on he inside he is a good person. I\u2019m just blown away that this happened. I want to protect my daughter above all else. I\u2019ve told him if he moves back in and anything like this happened again I would report it and he would lose his kids. He swears it was just a glitch and he was just depressed and he is very, very sorry for it and he would never do it again. He did not ever touch her, and when he asked that of her she said no, so he didn\u2019t see her at all. It was mostly just words but I know words can be the most hurtful. I really just want to know if you think it\u2019s possible for us to keep our family together if everyone gets some therapy and help. Thank you for your time! (From the USA)",

Around 2 years ago I was put on anti depressants, which have worked pretty well. Around a year ago, I abruptly stopped taking them without really telling anyone. I\u2019m not really sure why, but I did. This was around the holidays, and I was on vacation with family friends in a vacation house owned by some of their relatives. Now, it was a beach house, and, being the middle of winter and family meant that it had not been cleaned beforehand. I was originally sleeping with my friend, but moved to my mom\u2019s bed. My father passed away when I was 9, which caused some underlying anxiety to get worse, along with the typical grief and depression. I slept ok for the first night, but on the second night, I could not relax. It was storming, and an outside swinging door was banging on the wall. This put me on edge. There was one or two old stains on the sheets, and because of that, I started picturing bed bugs or whatever in the bed. (Not hallucinating, just imagining). I then started to get the \u201cbugs crawling on you\u201d feeling, and started sobbing and babbling nonsense. I tend to do that when I get panicked. After around 15 or so minutes, my mom gave me my prescribed lorazapram, and I calmed down and went to sleep. The worst part was when I was on the 5 or so hour drive home. We have a minivan, and I like to sit in the way back to have more space to spread out. My younger sister, 9 at the time, was sitting in front of me. I\u2019m not sure how it started, but for what seemed like most of the drive, I was having a panic attack. But it was different. I also was hitting my sister, hard enough to hurt her, screaming nonsense, and basically having a tantrum. We live in a historical area, and while we passed signs for places I had been, I started yelling at my mom to go to the places. I really have no clue why. It was horrible. I was basically curled up in a ball, screaming and hitting my sister for at least an hour. I really can\u2019t remember much. I\u2019ve had other episodes like this, but not this bad.",

I\u2019ve been threatened to have child services called if I babysit for any of my sisters, I\u2019ve had people telling me to stay away from them because they\u2019re scared I\u2019ll hurt them or their loved ones, I\u2019ve even been told if I ever have a baby of my own (I\u2019m infertile so that\u2019s impossible anyways though) that cps would be called the day it was released from the hospital. Even my therapists try putting me in the hospital every single time I go off my meds (I take haloperidol and can\u2019t currently because my gallbladder makes me throw up when I take any meds or eat anything) because \u201cyou\u2019re a danger to yourself and others right now.\u201d I only started taking the meds this year, 21 years after the problems started. If I wasn\u2019t violent during those 21 years why do they think I\u2019ll be violent now? It\u2019s not bad enough I see demons and blood and horrible things that I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone, it\u2019s not bad enough I hear screaming a lot of the time, no they have to make it so I can\u2019t even tell them what\u2019s going on without being put in the hospital or evaluated to be put in the hospital. I don\u2019t get it, please can someone explain this to me?",

Recently graduated from law school. He has a fear of being around people and hears voices, started neglecting personal hygiene, spends compulsively (ie. Bought 4 jackets exactly alike, 3 still in the package.) but does not have the budget for it. The real problem, every time he goes to get help they accuse him of just wanting to get drugs, but he hates taking any drugs. Also, doesn\u2019t think he has a problem except the sleep issue. He keeps saying if he could just get sleep everything will be fine, even after a good night\u2019s sleep. How do we convince health care providers there is a problem?

When i moved in me and my \u2018aunt\u2019 were only planning on being here for a few months until we were able to save more money and get an apartment closer to where she wants to live/ where I\u2019m transferring for college. The 3 other roommates dont clean, nor take care of their cat and almost starve and leave her waste out to stink.

After talking among themselves they decided to stay, and thats when things went south. In response, I started working more hours and working out outside of that so that I could focus on our goal of moving out.

When I was 10 I found out that when I was two my mom had suffered from depression, my dad said it was because she was pregnant and then had a still born baby on Christmas Eve. However very soon after my parents talked to me about that my mom lost her job and was out of work for two years. She started changing, she was gaining a lot of weight and would cry all the time. All my life she had been able to sleep a lot but once she lost her job she wouldn\u2019t get out of bed for days. Once she got a new job she seemed \u201chappier\u201d but then she became obsessed with work and likewise obsessed with my schoolwork. It was unacceptable if I got a B, it wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough.\u201d However even though she had a job she would sleep all the time and would always be crying. It got to the point that between work and sleeping she didn\u2019t have time for any of the normal mom things. She stopped doing laundry, cleaning, coming to my basketball games, and so I picked up her slack. Ever since I\u2019ve been doing all my families laundry, cleaning the house, planning out what we need from the grocery store every week and if she ever offered to for example do the dishes so I could go to bed I\u2019d wake up the next morning and they wouldn\u2019t be done.

Also every time I try to talk to her about a problem with a guy or anything she turns it into her problem and I always end up holding her while she can\u2019t stop crying. All of this started, because she lost the baby and after she lost the baby it was like I wasn\u2019t good enough for her. I wasn\u2019t a good enough reason for her to try to get better I wasn\u2019t good enough to keep her happy I wasn\u2019t good enough for her because I got a 92 in biology and \u201cruined my chances of going to a good college.\u201d If I\u2019ve never been good enough for her then how can I be good enough to help her?

I asked her if she wanted to do sexual activities. I also did not approach her by asking her in that way. When I was a really young child, I use to get in trouble by my parents from touching myself. Where that was when my parents used this word to describe my action in a different language. Therefore, that was how I approached my sister on asking her. I have posted in other forums on different websites like Yahoo and PsychForum. They stated that it was a form of molestation or sexual assault. I did ask her for consent. However, thinking about it now, I don\u2019t think it counts \u2014 she was only 5 years old. I really do think it was a form of molestation.

I think first is the issue of discipline. My partner, to me, is very inconsistent in his discipline being simultaneously too harsh and lenient (ex. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my belt if you don\u2019t listen and I am not giving you anything to eat, now come here and give me a hug. Want to watch TV?\u201d). I do not directly address this in disagreement but he can tell from my facial expression that I am not with this. So he gets extremely defensive. All I can say is that I am allowed to have thoughts and those thoughts can disagree. But he wants me to agree with him and I just do not. There is also a jealousy issue. I bought his kid a stuffed animal and my partner says \u201cit\u2019s a good thing that I didn\u2019t buy a stuffed animal like I was going to cause then we would have to see whose gift he likes more\u201d. On Christmas day, when kid opened up a guitar he received from his dad and couldn\u2019t put it down, his dad yells \u201cHe likes my gift the best. I win!\u201d. The incidents that I mentioned above were minor but there have been really big arguments that have ensued from either in which my partner\u2019s go to excuse for yelling and screaming is that he is the parent and I need to stay in my lane. Just to clarify, once me going out of my lane involved me getting a lint roller to remove cat hair from his son\u2019s pjs before he put it on. I had matching pjs and the plan was that me and his kid were going to wear the pjs and have a movie and popcorn night. His dad said that he couldn\u2019t wear the pjs because he needed to get the cat hair off first. He was in the middle of cooking so I went to do it. I was yelled at for trying to undermine his authority because he already said that his son was not to wear those pjs at all (that was not what he said). I honestly feel it was a ploy to ruin pajama night. I am noticing that part of the problem is that my partner doesn\u2019t want certain things getting back to the baby mama for fear she will use their kid as leverage and not allow him to see his son.

Years ago he had some sort of breakdown and moved in with my parents and stayed for 4 yrs. I found some odd things on his computers. He was on some sort of online site with animals portrayed as humans. A curvy woman\u2019s body with a sexy fox female face. I also found a small lion cub (Simba) stuffed animal with a small circular hole under the tail that was hot glued around the circle so that one could see the stuffing inside. I am guessing he was using it as a sex toy. I told my mother she asked me to call the psychiatrist he was seeing. I did he told me to get him out of the house immediately. I told my mother and she had him leave. He was laid off 2.5 yrs ago I found evidence of the same sort of behavior. This time it was a small black panther with the same odd hole under the tail and glued around, also his screensaver had a picture of a sexy woman with a fox face. I see little foxes scattered around the room he stays in. Guessing it\u2019s his female animal of choice. I never said anything to my mother she\u2019s been ill so I kept quiet. Lately he and I don\u2019t get along. We (husband and I) don\u2019t trust him. We lock our doors even if we are only outside feeding the dogs. He always lies and has already stole from us but denies it. My mother says she can\u2019t survive without him. Rather than looking for he decided to stay here and care for our mother. She could do more for herself but he waits on her hand and foot. We got into an argument and I told her we were going to have to move I can\u2019t stand living with him. She doesn\u2019t want me to leave. I would like to confront him but not sure how far to push this. He\u2019s very passive aggressive. I know I should leave but really can\u2019t afford to and my mother wants us to stay. She may not live much longer anyway. How do I survive in the mean time? He\u2019s creepy.",

        "Patient Question": "I am having ongoing difficulties in getting heard and am feeling really discouraged to the point that I don\u2019t want to bother trying to communicate or assert as I feel it doesn\u2019t work anyhow. I\u2019ve done numerous communication, assertiveness and conflict resolution courses and use the suggested techniques (outline the facts, stating the feeling, wants and at times a positive or negative consequence using neutral language, I statements, asking the other person/s what they think, what would work etc). But I don\u2019t get heard. At work I don\u2019t get taken seriously by a colleague I work with on a joint project, my asserted work needs & suggestions get ignored. I\u2019ve discussed this with my manager asking I be included on planning meetings they have explaining I could raise my work needs & suggestions & I work better when I have the context rather than be given bits of work. I make many suggestions of how I can contribute meaningfully on work projects but am getting more & more admin work. I wasn\u2019t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I\u2019ve done work I\u2019ve been given well & enthusiastically. I\u2019d like to discuss this concern with my manager but fear I won\u2019t get heard as nothing has changed when I\u2019ve discussed things with my manager in the past. I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I\u2019ve face to face & via email asked that they advise they can\u2019t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements & avoid last minute disappointment. I\u2019ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations. I\u2019d suggested people feel free to arrange additional impromptu events but said if someone were to do so please RSVP quickly either way otherwise no one will want to organize anything if no one responds. The other week I\u2019d issued an invitation to have only 1 person acknowledge it. With initiating new friendships I\u2019m so discouraged there as despite joining many things I feel afraid to initiate things as people often say no they are too busy. So I target activities that are ongoing so I have contact with the same people so friendships build slowly without initiating too early to be knocked back. In past workplaces I\u2019m often not included in pub invites or lunches with others who do a similar job. Advising I know of such events and would be interested in being invited doesn\u2019t work. I hence now feel awkward and shy, not wanting join in informal activities (e.g. invite myself to sit and chat to the other tenants in my block of flats who sit int he front garden) preferring more formal structured activities. I\u2019m at a dead end here. I\u2019ve been to therapy, been told I have good communication skills, I have no personality disorders. I\u2019m generally positive, well presented, interested in others, talk about a wide range of things, keen to get out there. I don\u2019t bitch or say negative things about people. I\u2019ve worked hard on communication and assertiveness. I just don\u2019t feel like continuing to try.",

I deal with chronic suicidal thoughts, frequent self-harm, I apparently engage in risky behaviors, I lack eye contact, I can\u2019t tell the difference between different emotions, I don\u2019t feel pain, I have social anxiety, I don\u2019t like to be touched, I freak out if things aren\u2019t in the right order or the same place, specific sounds drive me up a wall, I can\u2019t concentrate with any noise, I get obsessed about certain things, I stutter whenever I read, I get overwhelmed/frustrated really easily, the only emotions I feel like I feel are angry, frustrated, and empty,and I apparently dissociate to a certain extent, I also think I may hoard some things, and I have trouble relaying to people through words what is going on/what I feel. The thing that mind-boggles me is the fact no one believes I live in two worlds, people from both world\u2019s say that the other world isn\u2019t real. In my other world my therapist there says that I should leave Earth so I can be there and be peaceful. I can go there, and my friends from there can come here. Sometimes they follow me around during the day and correct me when I am not doing what they want me too. I am so confused what place is real, I am sure you are going to say Earth is real, but what if it\u2019s not, how do I know the right thing to do? Well, my psychiatrist thinks that they are just a way of me coping. Then that would mean that they aren\u2019t real, but they are? I am so confused. My therapist has no clue. I feel like therapy just makes things worse, I end up completely \u201cshutting down.\u201d Medicines don\u2019t help either. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.

We would have celebrated our third year together June 12th 2016 had he not broken up with me on march 7th. I loved him so much, but I began slipping away when he wasn\u2019t trying to get me anymore (didn\u2019t make me feel wanted) so then I started being distant, rude, and it wasn\u2019t hard for me to start arguments on anything. I realize I pushed him away so much. When we had arguments he saw me as an evil person who didn\u2019t know when to stop arguing. I realize we had a serious lack of communication, and that I was trying to get his love back by fighting and making him feel bad so he would love me more. That logic makes no sense, I know. I feel incredibly sorry about everything I have done to push him away in the relationship. We moved in together for our first year of university and that is when things started to go down. I didn\u2019t cook much, didn\u2019t listen to him, anything. I would love for him to see how wonderful I truly am and not the person he\u2019d been with for the past year. His parents are very much involved in his life. On the night before he broke up with me I texted him because he hadn\u2019t texted me in two days (we went home for march break) and was upset over it. He told me he wanted to spend time with his family and that if I had nothing good to say to not text him. I left him alone but I called him around 11pm. He was drunk at a friends. I told him our relationship was obviously over if he were to do things like that, I swore a bit on text, etc. The next day he texted me he was on his way home, that I was to find my own drive and that he was going up with his parents and moving out because he couldn\u2019t do this anymore. His parents told him to move out, I am fairly certain. Some parts of our texts he said he still has feelings, and at the end he told me no. Please help fix this!",

But our family dynamics were already weird he moved when I was 3 so never really had a relationship anyway. It really hit my mum I guess as her parents had both died within the last year and she took it hard and i feel like she got quite sad. It was already tense that he didn\u2019t want to go to the funeral, due to different religions. Then she found out about a month after her dad died that he was cheating. I was the one that discovered it by text anyway and I told her. Everything\u2019s been a mess now and she\u2019s changed so much. We used to be relatively close and in the first few months she was just always angry at me or crying because of him and since my brothers went to university it\u2019s just been me and her. It feels like she\u2019s so codependent on me and I can\u2019t turn her away cause she\u2019s my mum and that\u2019s not me but it\u2019s hard because I can barely deal with my own problems (depression). Now although it\u2019s been a few months it just feels horrible all she\u2019ll talk about is that other woman, whom she just follows around on social media and my dad. Everyone\u2019s told her to just leave him but she won\u2019t say that people told her it\u2019ll affect us, but it really won\u2019t it\u2019d just be better really. She doesn\u2019t think about what I want anymore just what she thinks or people tell her. She\u2019s always on the phone to other people, got a massive extended family and it\u2019s too the point where I\u2019m just ignored and neglected, despite me making time for her. I feel like she doesn\u2019t even love me anymore. Sometimes she\u2019s say sorry so she knows she ignores me. It\u2019s hard it\u2019s my gcse year and this mess has just made my already bad mental health worse. I feel bad because life\u2019s been hard for her since she\u2019s essentially got with him, she got ill after pregnancy and poor financial decisions have moved her from the middle class to poor.

This course load, in addition to the requirement of studying for numerous standardized tests / college admissions tests made me quite stressed in the first half of senior year. This eventually developed into a condition similar to depression (though not quite at that magnitude), and I began seeing a psychologist regularly. At the time I got really into the Beatles, and I found that listening to their music was a great coping strategy. Time went on and I gradually grew out of my slump, and actually got to enjoy the latter half of senior year. However, now, whenever I listen to the Beatles, or any other music I listened to near that gloomy time, I am flooded by bad memories and emotions that take a toll on my entire day, sometimes the entire week.

In the picture, I think it was a moving picture, he put his tongue in my mouth and was tongue kissing me. I didn\u201dt notice this at first and once I did I was alarmed and confused but I didn\u201dt say anything outright, I just kept trying to figure out what year that photo was taken because I was sure I was two in the picture. My grandmother and my father looked at the back of the photo and tried to find what date it was taken. Neither seemed to see or acknowledge what I was seeing and were even trying to somewhat distract me with trivial things, though I don\u201dt know if that was intentional or not. We couldn\u201dt find the date and they were unconcerned. I remember immediately thinking when I saw my grandfather kiss me that it was molestation, that I was witnessing myself being molested as a child and that it was wrong ; but I didn\u201dt really make a big deal out of it. Even though I was alarmed to see it because it was both so out of character for my grandfather and so wrong/disgusting beyond that I didn\u201dt really feel anything. A little disbelief maybe. After not being able to find the date I allowed the rest of my paternal family to distract me and didn\u201dt bring it up again or care. In fact I went on to have a completely unrelated dream and when I woke up I remembered thinking every dream except that one was significant only to realize later on that I had seen something incredibly disturbing but again with no big reaction.

During the time that my vehicle was working I drove her around to help her with errands (depositing money from her benefit), taking her to pay bills, etc. She filled up my tank in exchange, but a month later my car\u2019s transmission failed. She texted me recently and said \u201cYou need to step up\u201d, I\u2019m currently without a car, I have no sleeping schedule (it varies as my SO works nights), and I am experiencing signs of Agoraphobia. It is so intense that sometimes I pace between my front and back door trying to feel safe enough to go outside for a Cigarette. I don\u2019t understand how to heal myself let alone be something better for my Sister. And It truly is heartbreaking. All my life my parents told me \u201cYou just gotta get over it\u201d, but after 25 years of \u201cgetting over it\u201d (just pushing it down inside), I was starting to be successful and find a job that I really enjoyed (because I was helping people) as a Pharmacy Technician. I worked at Humana as a Call center Tech., and I started hearing Voices. I knew they weren\u2019t there, because I\u2019d say \u201chuh?\u201d and my co-workers would tell me they didn\u2019t say anything. It got to the point where I actually admitted to my boss that I have anxiety and it really affects me to the point where I panic to even go to work. I have quit so many jobs due to this.. and I have never lasted more than a year at any of them. My sister (the one with cancer) told me years ago that I needed professional help, and the minute I seek out for it, she tells me I am full of crap. I am basically wanting to know if any of this is justified, and I\u2019m unsure of how to react of feel.. I am hurt, in a way I have already mourned her, and it\u2019s hard for me to empathize with her when she\u2019s treating me like this.. What do i do?",

Normally, we get along perfectly, each respecting one another\u2019s problems, such as George\u2019s \u2018depression\u2019 and Harry\u2019s \u2018schizophrenia\u2019 (both of which have not been diagnosed or discussed with a professional). Unlike the other two, I seemingly lack a few emotions, such as grief, remorse, and empathy. Normally, this is more of a strength than a weakness, but as of late, it has been rather difficult to deal with. It\u2019s perfectly normal for me to experience urges to kill living creatures or to break inanimate objects, and these urges are understood by Harry and George. However, with each passing day these urges seem to grow stronger, and Harry and George seem to grow more\u2026\u2019on edge\u2019. When we discuss the subject, the others seem to react with more fear, or aggression, than they used to, and they don\u2019t seem to understand my situation as well as they used to. Previously, I could control my urges perfectly. I fidget a lot, which used to calm the urges, and I can also be quite destructive if I want something (I chewed through a television remote so that I could play with the rubber buttons inside), which also helped. Leaving windows open and then killing the insects that entered the house was another good way to calm myself. However, none of these methods seem to do much good anymore. I want something more, something bigger. Hunting is out of the question for me \u2013 there isn\u2019t anywhere to go in my local area and if I ask an adult it will arouse suspicion (they all believe that Harry, George, and myself are a singular, \u2018normal\u2019 entity). With each day these urges growing stronger, I also grow more impatient and frustrated with tiny details. Things \u2013 and people \u2013 are bothering me more and more, and this is encouraging my fantasies of killing them. There\u2019s only two people I would never be able to kill, and they\u2019re not a part of my family, which means I have to control myself greatly each day around the people I\u2019m supposed to \u2018love\u2019. With all of that said, it brings me onto my questions. What can I do to calm my desire to kill? And, lastly, is calming my urges that only way to make Harry and George feel comfortable with me again?

While I was on my way to the gathering I got a text from my boyfriend asking me where I am and I sent a message telling him where I was going but apparently the text hadn\u2019t gone and he thinks that I ignored his message because I didn\u2019t want him there. He doesn\u2019t like any of my guy friends. He\u2019s a Muslim boy and I\u2019m not so there\u2019s a lot of cultural clashing in terms of clothing, views etc. My parents do not accept him but I love him with all my heart. I feel numb and I can\u2019t think straight. I don\u2019t know what to do now. Please help me. Please. (From Sri Lanka)",

The other day he messaged me saying his head was telling him to skin his (10-year-old) sister and his brother and taste their blood. I was at loss for words but I had been trying to get him to tell me what was wrong. A part of me kind of wishes I hadn\u2019t asked. I want him to get some help. He has been cutting and punching\u00a0things messing up his hands. I have always been suicidal so I can\u2019t relate to him. I just want to try to understand. I\u2019m so lost and confused imp worried I might say the wrong thing. I told my best friend and he told my dad. My dad said if he doesn\u2019t get help then we can\u2019t be together. Mind you I turn\u00a018 in 2 months so what he says doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m just so scared. He has been controlling over me and even violent a couple of times. But when I confronted him about it he didn\u2019t know he was doing anything wrong. He has PTSD from watching his twin brother die in front of him in a car wreck. He usually sat in the same seat but the day of the accident he switched seats with his brother. he blames himself because his dad blamed him before he passed away of cancer in prison for drug distribution. I\u2019m kind of scared of him sometimes. I cut my hand on accident once cooking and his eyes when he seen the blood, he was like a completely different person. like he had no soul for a minute until he calmed down. he feels like killing people\u00a0when they annoy him. and I\u2019m always cautious around him now. But I\u2019m in love with him. and I just want him to get help. I called his school. instead of calling the cops which is what the crisis team wanted me to do. and I talked to him. he has agreed to go to the hospital to get help. but I didn\u2019t tell him I told the school and\u00a0the school told his mom. I\u2019m scared on how he will react to that. I just need some advice. I have no idea what to do. And now I\u2019m getting some bad thoughts too. I have learned to control them. But I use drugs to help me. and\u00a0he\u2019s okay with it. he\u2019s okay with me cutting and using drugs. I know that\u2019s messed up. I just don\u2019t know.",

        "Patient Question": "Hi, I have been with my partner for nearly 3 years and we have been through a lot. I forgave him at the beginning of the relationship when I found out he cheated on me, but I have never managed to rebuild the trust. He has changed, worked really hard and is a great guy in many ways BUT one thing. The biggest issue we have is when he goes out/goes for a drink. I keep on telling him that I am unable to trust him unless he keeps me posted, comes home at a reasonable or agreed hour, answers his phone if I call him late at night. But him going out often results in us arguing as he never sticks to his word and the worst thing that he does is he disappears. What I mean by that is that he would just disappear for the whole night and not answer his phone/messages. So obviously this makes me feel really disrespected as I sit there all night waiting and going crazy worrying if he is safe, if he is with another woman, if he is injured\u2026like there are so many things that go through my mind during those dreadfully long hours until he decides to get in touch or come home.",

I have been diagnosed with bipolar. I have very bad anxiety and frequent panic attacks. It has become so bad that I do not leave my house. I do not want to be around people, and if I have to it usually triggers a panic attack. I am on lexapro, lithium, xanax, seroquel, and because I can\u2019t sleep ambien. Although these meds get me through my days, they do not solve my anxiety, social phobia, and my depression is worse. I feel I am useless to my kids or my husband because of the psychological problems I cannot be normal. I cannot hold down a job. I have been treated since 2001 and nothing has worked. The fear I have of going out in public is the worst. The panic attacks and anxiety is so difficult on my body. I have thought of suicide before but I could never do that because of my kids that need me here. I often have disturbing thoughts that come from nowhere and I am alone most of the day. During this time I tend to sink deeper into my depression. I feel fatigued constantly and have no motivation to do even simple things around the house. My memory has become worse in just a short time. I cannot remember things that were said to me or that I say even within an hour ago. I repeat myself a lot because I don\u2019t remember anything or who I told. Is there any hope for someone in my situation? I feel like I suffer from so much that I have reached a point of no way out. No treatment has worked, and the meds just get me through day to day, but I still can\u2019t go out in public even with the medicines. I need help. Please.",

My mom talked to other parents but they didn\u2019t mind. Growing up I was the same me, I didn\u2019t like going to clubs or getting drunk but most of the people I knew did. I never criticized anyone, it just wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m 24 and I don\u2019t have friends, most of people I know just want the same things they wanted at 21: alcohol, parties and whenever they see me with a book then \u2018I\u2019m a loser\u2019. I do have a boyfriend. He finds interesting the way I am and doesn\u2019t judge me for being like the others. He does have friends, and I feel sad when he\u2019s sharing with his friends and I see it\u2019s great but I never found that on my own. Most of his friends get along with me, they say I\u2019m a good friend and I feel happy, but I would like to have my own friends too. My boyfriend\u2019s a lot more social than me so even if he\u2019s just watching a game with his friends I wish I could have something like that too. I went to a therapist and she told me I was an \u2018old cat lady in a younger body\u2019 and that I was depressed but I don\u2019t feel like that, I just enjoy different things. I\u2019d rather stay home and play board games than going out and forgetting everything the next day. I have gone to clubs, but I don\u2019t like to go every weekend. That\u2019s why most of the friends I had called me a freak until I decided I was sick of having friends who weren\u2019t really nice, or when they stopped talking to me. Is there something wrong with me? Since everyone says I have to make an effort I don\u2019t know if I have to change who I am so people can like me and not make fun of me.

I pick at my chapped lips for hours at a time, as well as ripping open the skin around my fingernails, and picking off all scabs multiple times \u2013 I have very limited personal relationships with people and struggle to make friends \u2013 I had 2 childhood friends that I kept for a long time (one for 8 years, one for 10 years) the 8 year friendship ended recently and I really don\u2019t feel like I miss her \u2013 When my family goes out of town for long periods of time I don\u2019t really miss them but when they call I tell them I miss them because I feel rude if I say that I don\u2019t \u2013 I hardly spend time with my friend (the 10 year friendship I mentioned) I see her maybe once every couple months \u2013 ' \u2013 I lie a lot and am extremely secretive",

We have shared custody of the children along with her first husband; he has primary custody during the school year. We live in a different state from her first husband. The children travel occasionally during the school year to stay with us, and spend the summers with us. I have a good relationship with both of the children. When the children are in our home, the son frequently expresses strong reactions against sleeping in his own bed. He would prefer to sleep in our bed with his mother and me or on the floor next to us.",

        "Patient Question": "My mom and dad recently got divorced. I have one sister who is 19 and lives 2 hours away at college and they told us together in January when we were visiting her that they were getting a divorce. I am fine with that my sister didn\u2019t speak to our family for a month or two and this march I thought my mom was up to something and I told my dad my suspicions and he tried to dismiss them but I couldn\u2019t let it go so I dug around a bit. I suspected she had cheated on my dad and was still with this guy. I drove by my mom\u2019s house one night and saw a random car there around midnight, and it was still there at 5 AM the next morning. I noticed this about 6 other times. I hid a voice recorder in my mom\u2019s house and played it back and I heard things no child should hear. His name is Rick and he is getting divorced too and he and my mom are in a relationship. That and a few unmentionable things are what I learned from the recording. I told my dad and he said he found out earlier in the year from a PI he hired and when they signed the divorce document my mom told him everything. He told me what he knew and my mom has been seeing this guy for 10 years and she isn\u2019t planning on telling my sister or I, nor does anyone on my mom\u2019s side of the family know\u2026 they never will. SO basically, my mom doesn\u2019t know I know and my dad only disses my mom with me and I don\u2019t show anyone how bad it hurts me. I can\u2019t tell my sister because she would literally leave my family and it\u2019s not my place to tell her, but secretly I wish she had gone through it too so someone could feel the pain I feel and so I could have someone to talk to, I know that\u2019s awful. My dad can\u2019t see it hurts because I have to be there for him. This divorce broke him and he has become my bff through it and I can\u2019t be weak I have to be strong for him. I can\u2019t stand my mom now that I know the truth. She lies about EVERYTHING and its so easy to see the truth. I think my sister has the \u201cignorance is bliss mindset\u201d but I get in moods where I flip out and cry because of this and have Panic attacks. Please Help. There is still alot more I feel but only so many words are allowed. I have all ot these bottled up feelings and I have to be strong around everyone and im tired or being strong. I\u2019m just so tired.. life is so tiring I cry at the slightest thing and this is affecting all of my relationships and im constantly sad and mad but I try so hard to never show it.

        "Patient Question": " I have been dating my boyfriend for about 1 year now. I moved from Arizona to Colorado to be with him. HE was living with his Mom and so I moved in as well. He paid her rent for his room and he did things for her around the house. When I moved in she also charged me for rent for sharing HIS Room. At first we got along but as time went on I began to notice things. She would constantly text him while we were just in the room next to her, she would constantly yell out his name for him to come\u2026 and just ask things of him. HE isn\u2019t working as he is on disability and had been in jail. Well soon he got into some trouble again and his mom called the police on him and my mom and I had to bail him out ..his mom wouldn\u2019t and sat around saying how glad she was he in jail. Now that he is out she is back to the same..this time we don\u2019t live there but she is always asking him to do this and that and talking badly of me. They text constantly and even sometimes when he and I are talking he will text her. and it\u2019s weird stuff..like how handsome her son is and calls him her baby and sends him emoji\u2019s like sunshines and things. I find it strange how he is always needing to go see her and will find any excuse to do so. While he was living with her he gave her all his money and she gave it out to him accordingly., I came along and I pointed out how he needs to be independent.. he is 48 years old!!!! so he did listen to me on that. But I can\u2019t seem to understand this relationship with his mom. She isn\u2019t very good to him and he is allows her to be so disrespectful to me. I am getting tired of it.",

About a year into our relationship I had to take a break from it because I had a history of violent sexual abuse that I had to get help for and our relationship was hard for me to participate in during that time. About 3 months into our break we started going out on dates and working toward getting back to normal, but we were not officially together. During this time of dating and him pursuing me he had sex with another girl. 3 years passed and he never told me about the incident \u2014 since that happened we had moved in together and he asked me to marry him. I recently found out about the sex because he left his email logged on to my computer and he was emailing her an apology for his poor behavior with her. This is the first time he has been physical with another girl, but during other parts of our relationship I have caught him sexting his ex and at one point I found him texting one of his peers at school telling her that he didn\u2019t get enough attention from me and he wanted to kiss her and see if she was the thing missing from his life. I don\u2019t know how to proceed with him. I love him very much and our wedding is in 2 years but I\u2019m not sure after all of this if it is even worth the work it will be to fix our relationship. So should we work it out or should throw in the towel?",

        "Patient Question": "Hello, I need help. I have strong urges to torture people/animals and force them into a bloody death. Blood satisfies me, I find pleasure from leaving self-inflicted cuts on my skin. At first I thought I was just depressed but I don\u2019t hurt myself for that reason, I hurt myself to see my blood. I like the way it looks and feels. But that\u2019s not the only violent act I wish upon myself, I fantasize about being tortured, I want to die as a murder victim, I want my murderer to cut open my body, I want to see my insides. These strange fantasies scare me, I can\u2019t stop myself from thinking this way. In my spare time I catch myself glaring at people, planning their gruesome murder and seeing how I\u2019d get away with it. I physically want to kill someone but I mentally don\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure if this is making sense to you, because it doesn\u2019t even make sense to me. The only thing stopping me from hurting others is getting my satisfaction from illegal videos online, on gruesome websites such as \u2018bestgore.com\u2019 and \u2018liveleak\u2019. On these websites, people upload either real-life murder videos that they have committed, or videos of gruesome things that they have seen. I am not disgusted by dead bodies, gore or blood. Instead, I wish to be in a situation involved with a lot of blood. I have two very close, childhood friends that know about this, but no one else knows. I\u2019m afraid that one day I\u2019ll be sent to a mental institution if I end up doing something horrible. Let\u2019s backtrack a little. I grew up in an abusive family, i don\u2019t want to get into that situation but it might have something to do with the way I\u2019m feeling right now. Ever since I was a child I had always loved death and gore, I remember when I was young, I watched the movie \u2018Titanic\u2019. I was never interested in the romance, instead, I would skip ahead to the scene where the ship sank and the passengers froze to death. Whenever my parents weren\u2019t home, or I was alone, I\u2019d play that scene. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, I really need your help.",

        "Patient Question": "For many years now my partner has insisted he needs to rest a lot. He rests for hours after coming home from work and spends all afternoon on the couch sleeping on the weekends. Yet he is not distressed by this and he doesn\u2019t ask his doctor to fully investigate this or continue going back saying I\u2019m still tired. And when he\u2019s been offered referrals to suitable specialists refuses to go. Hence I\u2019m wondering if this is a red flag in a relationship. In the past I\u2019ve raised this issue asking him to get his fatigue fully investigated and to take up any referral offers advising of it\u2019s impact on our relationship (limited activities together, no kids as I felt he wouldn\u2019t cope with active kids plus being unfair on kids to be cooped up due to their father being too tired to be active with them) as well as saying it can\u2019t be very pleasant for you to feel like this and wouldn\u2019t it be better to feel less tired and have the energy to do things. I\u2019ve also suggested sedentary activities but he\u2019s not interested. He also doesn\u2019t want to take any medication not even vitamins or trial antidepressants. It is hard on the partner as the partner starts off feeling sorry for the fatigued person and accommodates their need to rest to find several years down the track they\u2019ve spent their life sitting on the couch rather than living life. And I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s just not normal to have this excessive need for rest yet not be distressed by this. I could understand more if he had health problems that couldn\u2019t be treated but he tests as being very healthy and somehow has a high level of fitness. A bit of context \u2013 he does appear to have OCPD but many people with OCPD aren\u2019t chronically fatigued. I\u2019ve extensively tried to get out on my own to build my own life and am now in the process of preparing to leave. I\u2019d like to have the opinion of psych central as we hear a lot about red flags but I\u2019ve not read much about this one which can be used as another way to control someone. (From Australia)",

He hasnt started a new career, couldnt get into the military, so I want him home. He is worried that moving back will bring back bad habbits, when I feel it was just escapism and more a bandaid verus getting to the issues as drinking is still an issue. He feels most comfortable with his sister, my job is stationary my career being 10 years strong with the federal government, I dont see the need to move when he only works in a bar (of all places) but doesnt fully support himself. I feel his mind races and he has coping issues and learning how to move stuff in the past. He had issues with his parents, being mixed race. Now I want him home, I know we have things to work on, but he is more terrified of facing the area where the issues with drugs were. He is up and down, agreed to move back but still having issues with facing the area and the people. His alcohol consumption is terrible, through the roof at least 5 drinks per day and sometimes can finish a gallon in as little as 2 days.

They\u2019re one of the best things about my life, and ever since we finished school, I haven\u2019t seen them very often, which has been a little depressing for me. However, my parents are a bit conservative and don\u2019t think I should go out a lot (weekly outings are their definition of a lot. They\u2019d prefer an outing every 2 months or so.) It may seem a bit like a juvenile problem, but we\u2019ve come to an impasse. I don\u2019t think I go out enough, they think I go out too much, so I figured we can ask a professional to get a correct answer once and for all. I personally think outings help me keep a healthy mental state, but the debates every single time I want to go out have been mentally draining. I hope your answer would put an end to this problem, if you say I\u2019m right I hope they\u2019ll be convinced and if you say they\u2019re right I\u2019ll let go of this exhausting battle.

He has a wonderful life of going to the gym and doing some housework and laundry. I have a good job and got a 30% pay raise last year. That was a total disincentive for him. I want us to work on retirement together, not me working till I die and him having a great time. I am angry and becoming bitter and I don\u2019t like me the way I am.

I have bought him groceries for nearly a couple months, shown him loyalty and love. He brought up us getting married, which was to early but now at a year I feel it\u2019s fine to get engaged. He\u2019s a bit older than me, i\u2019m 29 and he\u2019s 39. Iv\u2019e been told that he may have these profiles up related to self esteem or validation issues. He has a tendency to self deprecate himself and often asks me if I love him. I wished you could meet him and you would understand. I\u2019m paranoid you think i\u2019m sounding like a unhappy girlfriend. Why would someone show you such strong devotion in person, yet act insane and persue others online?",

He is now in his late fifties and he is beyond caring for himself. The last 4 or 5 living situations he was in (apartments) he was evicted for strange behavior like melting cassette tapes in the oven and starting a minor fire and bothering neighbors , including many other things. He stopped with all hygeine practices. He stopped being able to pay bills do to poor money mangement and lack there of. So he squatted with a few friends all of whom eventually sent him packing not at first realizing the extent of his illness. So after every fallout with his friends whom he has been staying with he ends up at my door with a police escort after they find him wandering the cold streets late at night. I live in a 1 bdrm apartment with my girlfriend and two large dogs. I am not equipped to deal with another person in such confined quarters let alone his illness. As you probably have guessed he refuses medication as well as his illness. He has other health issues that I know nothing about and he will not see a doctor, especially with me present. He has a ventalin inhaler that is prescribed to him that he uses way more than he was origanally suppossed to , along with smoking two + packs of cigarettes a day. He can barely walk ten steps without being seriously out of breath. My father needs help that I can\u2019t give him and all the calls I\u2019ve made trying to find help has come to the same roadblock. Someone can\u2019t be forced treatment. I don\u2019t know what to do. This has been going on for years. This is Saturday and he came via police escort Thursday night just before midnight. I had to call off work Friday because I can\u2019t leave him alone at my apartment in fear he will do something and get me evicted, or worse. I\u2019m at the end of my ropes and don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t just send him out on the streets but it is affecting my happiness and comfort in my home which is very important to me. My girlfriend is supportive about it but it has already caused a strain. Sorry for the lengthy note but I really don\u2019t feel like I even grazed the surface. If there is anyway you can help with resources or ideas it would mean the world to me. Thank you.",

I saw her at the kitchen sink and he came up behind her and put his hands on her waist. Things like that. Recently she had a crush on a boy and there was teenage drama for about a week all of which my boyfriend didn\u2019t even really speak to my daughter. I almost felt like it was jealousy? On one hand I do not think he would ever harm my daughter. I tried to talk to him about behavior I feel is inappropriate and he thinks I am calling him a pedophile. Am I being unreasonable? What kind of behavior is ok and not ok? The kind of relationship I\u2019ve always had with my father is completely opposite and I wonder if maybe that\u2019s why I am feeling this way. It was hard for my dad to hug me and I never sat on his lap. My daughters dad left when she was 4 and is not in the picture and she has always tried to seek male approval. (age 32, from US)",

His symptoms are above all a need to \u201crun\u201d (it is a kind of fast pacing that he does in his room or outside) and a very large need to be a alone a lot and not socialize. Also he finds all criticism and people disagreeing very difficult and has always been very sensitive about how clothes feel. He hardly ever brings friends home, but functions well with friends at school. What I am worried about is his social life as he gets older. His ability to function with a girlfriend or boyfriend and at work. And his \u201crunning\u201d sometimes makes things difficult for him. He almost never wants to talk about how things are or how he feels. It is always only facts. He takes after his dad on a lot of things and I am wondering if a diagnosis would help prepare him for life, or make it more difficult.

He wants a family and we are about to buy our first home. He isn\u2019t very affectionate and we never sext or talk dirty. There are times I feel bored and invisible. A few months before getting married I had a bad day at work and received an email from a male colleague asking if I was ok and this led to us lunching together and progressed to us seeing each other outside of work too much and me feeling very confused a month before the wedding. I talked to my partner and I told him we\u2019d flirted and that I was enjoying the affection I felt was lacking with us. He was mature and said he would try harder and temporarily this worked. I got married with a clear conscious and didn\u2019t think about the other guy at all, we had a lovely day and he was very attentive but now its back to old ways and I\u2019ve got close to the work guy again.

I hear voices. Nobody else hears them apparently. They\u2019ve got names and I can tell which one\u2019s talking. Pan and Jacen talk the most, but there\u2019s Kiri and Winter and others. They are not me and they have distinct voices. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m being followed and this makes my heart race. Sometimes when I swing or walk on the sidewalk I feel like someone\u2019s going to shoot me or fire an arrow into my back. It\u2019s dumb, but I can\u2019t help it.

I fade into my mind and I don\u2019t remember anything except that when I\u2019m brought back to reality, time has passed. I usually do this in crowded places. What should I do? Do I have schizophrenia or something else?",

Since early adolescence, I am visited by an evil presence quite often while asleep. He tries to enter me and I am frozen in complete fear. He speaks to me and threatens me with things I can\u2019t bring myself to write or tell anyone. As a child my mom would take me to church and they would pray for deliverance but it never went away even though I eventually told her it did. A few years ago, I started seeing a psychologist for anxiety. After a year and a half of therapy I finally had the courage to tell my therapist about the sexual contact I had by three men when I was between the ages of 6-15yrs. My psychologist is convinced that these possession episodes are flashbacks to those experiences. Is he telling me the truth? I want to believe him but I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s been very difficult to process the memories from the childhood experiences because of the shame and guilt I feel for being so needy. I enjoyed the attention and even initiated much of the contact. I may have been a child but I knew it was wrong. I feel like God is punishing me.",

Receiving she likes but giving, please see anal sex comment. Much of our sex is in the bed and at night. When I suggest something new it is not met with approval. I think basically it comes down to this: she says that I am not satisfied even though we have very good sex. Adventuresome sex is out of the question and so is morning and afternoon sex, whether I suggest oral sex or regular bedroom sex. I think she is a wonderful sexual partner and a tremendous wife. But I think there should be more in the adventuresome area as well as positions, time of day, and varieties.",

I definitely do NOT want anyone to find out because I would probably wear the Scarlett letter in my family for the rest of my life. I like how it feels to hurt myself and I guess that makes me a masochist. I don\u2019t always cut, sometimes I bruise myself. I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m depressed or have a mental illness that would make me hurt myself, but I just want a professional opinion on this because I regret cutting myself since someone is bound to see the scar at some point or another. I got a little carried away one night and it is a pretty big, red scar. The scar doesn\u2019t bother me at all because I like to see marks on my body but I know my mom would probably have a stroke if she saw it. It\u2019s almost swimsuit season you know. I do feel insecure about my body, what teenage girl doesn\u2019t, but that does not even cross my mind when I self harm.

My father is often tired and stressed and my mother gets anxious even more than she used to now that grandpa is very ill and will often take out her anger or stress on us and will make scenes and leave the house for a few days.

My health insurance is shit and I still live with my parents who don\u2019t really believe in mental illness and think that I simply have to focus on other things and that it will pass. I don\u2019t have time. I don\u2019t have the strength. I\u2019m supposed to be graduating the next year. My family depends on me. This has to end. Please, help me. Help me now. I am a Caucasian man, eighteen. Never been diagnosed with a mental disorder. However, I would scare quite easily as a kid. Once, I even developed a brief fever due to stress. I also developed symptoms that I would later recognize as OCD and scrupulosity at the age of nine. It calmed down in my teen years. I was also bullied for a few years, but after moving to High school and fitting in I let that go. It all started out on November 14th this year. I swallowed a fishbone, and felt it stuck in my throat. I was really stressed out, I thought I was going to suffocate. I ate a lot of bread and drank a lot of water, but I never really felt it go down. I calmed down by the evening, and I slept quite well. The next morning, I watched a horror movie, then an episode of \u201cCold Case\u201d. It didn\u2019t really scare me or anything, but I felt\u2026 weird. Like I couldn\u2019t concentrate. And, sometimes, I would feel dizzy. Like I was going to faint. But it calmed down by the afternoon. I had a big dinner and drank a lot of water. I woke up quite early the next morning, with a nausea. I could barely eat. I was on the verge of vomiting the whole time. I kept googling my symptoms, fearing that I have a stomach ulcer, or even an internal bleeding. I calmed down by the evening, but I woke up at around one am, feeling cold and legs trembling. I didn\u2019t go to school on Monday, figured it was some sort of viral infection. But that night, I couldn\u2019t sleep again. I did go to school, but at around three pm, I would feel like I was on the verge of fainting. Like a barely controlled panic attack. But then I would calm down. On Wednesday night, I fell asleep. But in the morning, nausea. I spent the whole day stressing over that. Since the symptoms didn\u2019t pass, I got into my head, despite not being overly religious, that I must be demon posessed. That would really freak me out. I would calm down eventually, and realize how absurd those thoughts were, but when they would plague me, there was no room for reason. I barely had any apetite by that point. I gave my blood and urine up for testing. It all came back clean. The next week, my apetite has returned. But, at night, I would have horrible, violent nightmares. I would actually feel physical pain, despite sustaining no actual injuries, and wake up at around one or two am. I researched about a movie called \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d, that reminded me of my situation. I watched a few clips and read a plot synopsis. It only freaked me out more. For the next few days, everything would remind me of violence and horror images. Nightmares continued. Then I came to think of one movie (not a horror movie) that freaked me out as a child, but I eventually got over it. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. I watched a few clips on YouTube and it freaked me out even more. Now every day I have that scene in my mind, feel like I was when I was a child, with that irrational gut feeling that I will see that being from the movie when I open the door, look into the mirror, etc. Even before that, I was afraid of reverting back to a child-like state, becoming a failure, etc. Anyway, right now, it\u2019s like my body is wired. In the morning, I feel terrible, and only calm down by around five or six pm. I have that weird feeling, like I am a child again (back when everything was big and scary and I didn\u2019t really understand how the world works), constantly stressing over the things I know are not rational. I can\u2019t make positive associations anymore and I can barely study. Like my mind is, for no reason, afraid of those memories, so it keeps freezing up, and when it doesn\u2019t, those stupid thoughts keep interrupting me. It is like a combination of anxiety, OCD, and the world\u2019s creepiest deja vu. It\u2019s like my mind is constantly on alert, and worrying about intrusive thoughts. I actually have headaches because of stress. I feel better when I dissect my fears and talk about them, and actually LABELING myself (anxiety, OCD), but soon after the thoughts return, and I feel terrible again. Then I think \u201cwhat if there is no cure\u201d, \u201cwhat if I stay this way forever\u201d, \u201cwhy me\u201d, or \u201cwhat if there is some truth to this, since you are so afraid\u201d, and I just hit rock bottom. To make matters worse, there\u2019s been lots of exams lately and my family is going through some tense times. I can\u2019t catch a break. I have tried: -meditating -masturbating -exercising -focusing on other things -eating candy -rationalizing my fears -drinking alcohol (not much) -writing about my issues -talking about my issues with my parents -drinking chamomile tea I don\u2019t drink alchohol (except those two times), don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t do drugs.

        "Patient Question": "My husband of 18 years left a year ago, with no warning. He had demonstrated some strange behaviour during this time, but he is very secretive and deceitful and can hide things very well. Within a week of leaving his family of five children he lost his job. Prior to this he had been very successful in work. The past five years however he has changed jobs many times, although I don\u2019t think I have been told the real reason. He now doesn\u2019t see his children at all \u2014 one of these is a tiny baby and was less than three months when he left. Before this, he was a loving father. Since leaving he has not paid any financial support for his children although he is adamant that he has. He tells so many lies it is difficult to keep track. I believe that he believes his lies as he is so convincing. He tells lies that serve no purpose and are easily proven to be lies, yet he seems convinced they are true. He is also completely paranoid and accuses people of being out to get him. He comes from a family with an alcoholic father, which has never been acknowledged. My problem is that because we have split up, I have no influence over him at all. His family won\u2019t acknowledge that there is a problem, even though his behavior is completely out of character. I risk looking like a bitter ex wife, even though I am extremely worried about him and I know something has happened to trigger this behavior. He has gone from being a well respected father and family man to not seeing any of his children or his old friends. He has tattooed himself which he would never have done and he has run up huge debts. I am worried he will end up arrested. He has had violent out bursts, but only towards me, as far as I know. Does it sound like he has a mental health problem? I truly believe he is delusional.",

I started at 50mg of Zoloft, though soon I had to up it to 75mg then 100mg. I\u2019ve been doing okay with the 100mg, though sometimes I forget to take it. The reason it all started (What I believe\u2026) is after seeing the movie \u201cThe Conjuring.\u201d It messed with me, made me afraid of possession or going crazy and hurting someone I love. I still am afraid of these things, but not as much. I haven\u2019t watched any scary movies, but I\u2019ve seen previews and they cause my anxiety to go out the roof. Its 11:17pm right now and I am tired but I\u2019m not laying down because I am still afraid, except its slightly different.

It may be because I haven\u2019t been taking my Zoloft constantly, not that I ignore it, I honestly forget to take it. I went to my doctor last Monday and everything was okay, what should I do? Should I make another apt? I\u2019ve also had therapy, it did help a lot. Should I go back to therapy? Please let me know, I want a professional opinion before I freak even more out.

My younger sister has some major issues as well and is abusive to both me and my father. Despite this, he seems to prefer her more. He is a pretty unemotional man by nature, but he is always talking with her and they have a lot of fun. He mentors her gently and speaks very kindly to her. She\u2019s very mean to him, telling him to go and kill himself and has physically attacked both of us in the past, but he still adores her. I\u2019ve always tried to be a good kid and played mediator between my parents when they were divorcing. I\u2019ve gotten good grades, helped around the house, and even got accepted into a top university with a generous grant. I\u2019m not saying that that warrants affection, but my dad can\u2019t stand to be around me. He\u2019s always very critical and controlling of me, to the point where I\u2019ve begun to develop an eating disorder. He never sees my accomplishments as accomplishments and instead tears down what I\u2019ve done. He\u2019s always pushing me away in favor of someone else. There are times when he\u2019d rather be with his work buddies than with me. I try to joke with him, make him smile, make him things, and generally be the best daughter I can be, but I feel as if he just feels obligated to be around me because he\u2019s my father, not because he loves me. I feel this is because I look very much like his ex-wife, my mother. Or maybe it\u2019s for some other reason, I really don\u2019t know.

I am petrified that the drug could have been the catalyst, and maybe he will have another episode. What are your thoughts? Would a doctor agree to take someone off medicine for this condition?",

        "Patient Question": "Despite tireless efforts so that my family stays in the dark, I\u2019ve known for years now that there is something wrong with me. I have a family history of mental illness and OCD. I scored high on this site\u2019s OCD test. I\u2019ve attempted to point out behaviors in mind that point to OCD to my family but I\u2019m always shut down. I struggle with anger but, growing up, I was not allowed to express my anger at all. Even as a young child, I was expected to \u2018act mature\u2019 and couldn\u2019t even raise my voice a little, or I\u2019d get in trouble. Because of this, I privately turn my anger inward at myself; punching myself, scratching my skin, and getting into fits where I convulse and shake and cry\u2013 all while staying completely quiet, of course, because it would not be considered acceptable by my family members. It is how I learned to cope. I have thought before after I had finished having one of these \u2018fits\u2019 that if I saw a video of someone else behaving in the same way I would think that they were completely insane. Deviant behavior is held in low regard at my house; even people with tame fetishes my parents and sister proclaimed to be mentally ill and awful people. This way of thinking has been devastating to me, as a person with a few unothodox fetishes and is someone who enjoys \u2018kinky\u2019 behavior (I\u2019m not into pedophilia or rape or anything harmful like that, of course). I believe I\u2019m a disappointment for these interests. Certain sounds and physical feelings (for example, the sound of someone humming/singing in the feeling of my hands or arms being kissed or touched and parentheses are simply unbearable. They send me into a panic. These feelings are brushed off by my family if I mention it. I also engage in self stimulating behavior like biting or psyching my fingertips, bouncing my legs and rocking, and very frequent masturbation. Does any of this sound like there is something wrong with me or my just being too sensitive and overreacting like my family says I am wont to do? Sorry if it\u2019s a lot of information; I feel like it\u2019s all connected and if I can get an outside opinion maybe I can do something to help myself. Or maybe it\u2019s nothing. Either way, thanks a lot for reading.",

        "Patient Question": "I was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety as a teenager, dealing with cutting and bulimia. As the years have gone by, I\u2019ve been on and off of medications and while I knew I still dealt with the mental illness, I felt like I\u2019d grown a lot. Over the last couple of years, though, things have gotten bad again. It seems that I\u2019ll be fine or at least stable for months until something will go wrong, and it\u2019s like a house of cards toppling over. It\u2019ll send me spiraling into what I refer to as an episode for lack of a better word. I\u2019ve described episodes before to my previous nurse practitioner/psychologists, but it never occurred to me until recently that I should\u2019ve told them about the voice I would hear during the episodes. I\u2019ve always just thought of it as my own thoughts, except way louder and more aggressive, but after reading about the difference between your own voice in your head and hearing a voice, I\u2019m now more concerned about the episodes. The last time I had one, I ended up grabbing a bottle of pills, stealing a knife from my sister\u2019s house, sending my mom a goodbye text, and walking the streets in 20 degree weather while cutting myself and all at the urging of what I thought to be my own thoughts. However, looking back on it, I can still hear the voice berating me, referring to me in the third person instead of first. My thinking is completely distorted during these episodes, and as soon as I come out of it (usually within a few hours), I\u2019m embarrassed by my actions and think clearly again. For example, one time I was so anxious that no one would pick me to do a group project with them in class, that I went home and started cutting so my mom would have to take me to the hospital and I\u2019d get to miss school the day they chose partners. Is that delusional thinking? I\u2019ve never met someone with depression/anxiety who has episodes that intense and rapid. It\u2019s like feeling the craziness of mania, but without the happiness/confidence. Is there a such thing as having depression with psychotic episodes or is that normal and I\u2019m just thinking too deep into it or being a hypochondriac?",

As a kid, I was forced to study way ahead of my grade, and my mum used to teach me. Every time I got a question wrong, I used to get smacked with a rolling pin. Or when I made my mother angry, I was smacked, then dragged and thrown into the bedroom. I wasn\u2019t allowed to cry, otherwise she\u2019d punish me more. It was more when I was younger, but I learned not to make these mistakes. I sometimes used to get bruises and stuff. But afterwards, my mother would make it up to me by saying things like \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cYou will always be my cute daughter\u201d and buy me snacks. Otherwise, I enjoyed my mother\u2019s company. But it would confuse me, and still does. The memories sometimes haunt me, flashes of my mother dragging me into a room, and the sinking feeling in my heart as I know there\u2019s nothing I can do to escape. It\u2019s just so confusing. I still don\u2019t know if what she did to me is considered is \u201cabuse\u201d\u2026I know it\u2019s stupid but\u2026\u2026it\u2019s so confusing. My father helped me a lot although he was almost always working, he took me outside for breaks in studying and protected me from my mother sometimes. There has always has been two \u201csides\u201d. My mother\u2019s side and my father\u2019s side. I always had to choose, whose side I was on, but I don\u2019t know. I still don\u2019t know. My parents always fight, then somehow make up, then fight again, and the cycle continues. I don\u2019t know anymore.

I don\u2019t have to pretend, and I don\u2019t have to act. My mother had also stopped teaching me, she let me have my independence. But since my father was usually out, it left me and my mother alone. She always tries to justify and persuade me onto her side, telling me all these things which I really don\u2019t care about, but it just hurts me. I feel like I\u2019m being torn apart in half. I don\u2019t want to choose a side. Can\u2019t we just live in peace? I have always considered running away, but I have never had enough courage to do so, under the fear that my mother will always end up finding me and scream at me and punish me.

The problem is now I want to have a serious relationship, but after a couple of weeks ago by I start to lose interest in the girl. the girls are great, minor flaws, beautiful faces, great personalities etc. I feel attached to the girl but if I see another girl, I like I can\u2019t keep myself from asking her number, messaging her etc. Also, a major thing I have noticed is that if I start to get sexual with the girl, I start to lose interest after we go home (when we\u2019re no longer facing to face). This has been bugging me for about 7-8 months now and I\u2019m really starting to feel bad emotionally and psychologically. Right now, I have a girlfriend who is an amazing person with a great personality and she is just amazing overall. Like most girls, I unintentionally get them to love me and right now she is attached to me. I have this feeling inside that I want to leave her like my heart feels weird. This always happens a week or two before I leave a girl. This time I don\u2019t want to, I want to have a serious relationship. People are usually jealous that I have a multitude of girls wanting to be with me dating me etc. but it happens unintentionally and right now I just want to have 1 girl in my life. I sometimes cry about this because I don\u2019t know what to do. Thank you in advance. (From Turkey)",

There\u2019s nothing wrong with me from the outside looking, in fact, I always have admirers and guys who ask me out. I\u2019m funny, nice and quite good looking. However, I have a super hard time developing feelings for guys, and the few ones I really fall for never ever like me back, which makes me feel like a failure. I\u2019ve been on many dates with great guys who were serious and were looking for a relationship, and in the beginning when a handsome guy gives me attention I feel thrilled about it and even fantasize about us getting together, but as soon as he actually tells me he likes me or starts showing physical affection, the world turns upside down, and no matter how attracted I was to him, I start feeling sick, and feel like I\u2019m in a parallel universe because a good guy liking me is not supposed to happen in real life, just in my fantasies. It\u2019s like a thousand voices in my head start screaming at me how I don\u2019t deserve it and how life is playing me an evil trick and if I fall for it, something horribly painful will happen and I will make a fool out of myself. I don\u2019t even know how to word or interpret these feelings, but they take over me completely and I get confused, sad and repellant towards the guy. It always ends up with me running away, not looking back. I\u2019m always the one to break things up, no guy has ever really rejected me, and yet being rejected scares me so much my subconscious seems to drive me to \u201cleave before I get left\u201d as Taylor Swift puts it\u2026 So basically, when it\u2019s clear that a guy likes me back, I lose my feelings for him and get super uncomfortable instead. When I date more \u201cdouchy\u201d kind of guys, I feel safe, like things are the way they should, but then I also get annoyed by their behavior and keep thinking that I deserve someone better. I\u2019m so sad, lonely and confused, and I feel like something is wrong with me and I should be ashamed that I can\u2019t find a boyfriend.

        "Patient Question": "About 5 years ago, I started seeing a therapist weekly to do CBT for my lifelong anxiety. However, my anxiety quickly latched onto the therapy itself. I found myself worrying constantly about what the therapist thought of me and whether I was doing therapy wrong. Going to sessions became a major anxiety-inducing experience, and everything the therapist said felt like criticism. I eventually worked up the courage to talk to the therapist about the issue. She said she understood. We discussed it several times and challenged some of my beliefs about it. But it didn\u2019t help. So, a year later, I discontinued regular therapy. I learned a few useful strategies for anxiety but also came away feeling worse about myself. Last year, after experiencing some stressors in my life \u2013 which caused extreme anxiety \u2013 I went to see a new therapist. I thought this time would be different. I told the therapist right at the start about my therapy anxiety. Yet now, a year later, I find myself in the same pattern. I feel that my anxiety about the therapeutic process itself, and my relationship with the therapist, is getting in the way of therapy. The therapist is well aware of the issue and we discuss it frequently. She suggests things for me to do \u2013 ways to ground myself during sessions, exposure-based approaches to accept the uncertainty \u2013 but I\u2019m unable to do them, which makes me feel even more anxious and frustrated. Sessions have now turned into a huge performance anxiety thing for me because I\u2019m so afraid of how they\u2019ll go. My therapist doesn\u2019t *feel* like an ally to me (but I know it\u2019s not her, it\u2019s me). I\u2019m at a loss. Again, I feel worse about myself now than when I started therapy. I do okay in my life despite my anxiety \u2013 I have a full time job and a good long-term relationship. I would still like to find ways to reduce the amount of worrying I do \u2026 but I can\u2019t seem to be able to overcome my anxiety about therapy to make therapy useful to me. Do I quit and accept that therapy has too many side effects for me to be useful? Are there other ways to overcome my therapy anxiety?",

While I wanted to be there for her, I was also ready to start my own life. Unfortunately she decided for me to move back with her and my family far away from my friends, contacts and opportunities because she wanted me to be with her. I spent 6 months away from everyone and I got into a real depression because I had just graduated and I felt I needed to get a job and start a new life. After convincing my family to move back, they cut me off financially. I moved back to my old town but this time with no money and I was flat broke. In the meantime I developed an interest for a path that I want to pursue but I was not able to get the funds for a course or to buy a good laptop. I also lack skills and experience to get a \u2018real\u2019 job and I spent a few years working minimum wage jobs just to get by.",

She has manipulated her insulin/food intake three times in as many years to bring about a seizure episode and requiring ambulance/hospital intervention. She did this just this weekend by pretending to eat breakfast after administering insulin injection, then not taking her purse containing the glycogen she keeps there, resulting in her making a scene saying that she needed chocolate then eventually ending in a seizure and ambulance ride to the hospital.

When I was younger, I fantasized about indulging in this fetish with others but nowadays I only think about being incontinent on my own in a cabin far up in the hills in some woods where noone can find me with an incinerator! So basically, it has to be far away from real life and very hidden for me to find pleasure in it and to escape the shame. I do also have completely normal fantasies and nowadays have to force myself to think about this fantasy in order to orgasm, but it doesn\u2019t naturally come into my mind and, until properly aroused, I still find it genuinely disgusting.",

        "Patient Question": "Hi there, I have a question regarding to my mom and why she appears to hate me in comparison to my brother and sister. I\u2019m the oldest, my brother is the middle child and my sister is the youngest. My brother, my parents seemed to have focused majority of their attention on him which honestly wasn\u2019t a big deal to me, but my sister who has caused so much grief on my mom even calling her the c-word and run in with the law and being physically violent with her still is treated with so much more respect than me. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m perfect but I was a child of obedience, good grades, never swore, just desperately wanted to please my parents to no end, you get the picture. When I was a teenager she was physically and emotionally abusive with me, she went through a bad divorce with my dad and the death of her mother and sister so she did take it out on us, more so me and dealing with bulimia.\u00a0 My mom does depend on me now for rides to work because she lost her license and does have type 1 diabetes so I\u2019m the one responsible for her even though I want to move out and begin my life with my 7 year boyfriend. My mom doesn\u2019t approve of us living together so I am afraid she will end our mother daughter relationship because she\u2019s threatened it before. To this day she treats me horribly compared to my brother and sister even though I try hard not to start fights with her, I\u2019m very quiet and passive which I guess she hates? And she walks all over me if my sister refuses to do something for my mom. Whenever I have tried to tell her how I feel she manipulates me into thinking something is wrong with me, she also seems to have a narcissistic personality problem but I\u2019m not going to diagnose her. How can I begin my life without starting a war. An example that happened is that I expressed excitement over my future home that I offered that she can help decorate, she refused and said if I moved out she would never come over or talk to me but when my brother expressed wanting to move out she offered to pay his rent. Please help. (age 25, from Canada)",

But I wasn\u2019t sure if he was touching me at first so I just got out of the line because I felt his hand in my back but I wasn\u2019t sure, so I kinda let it go. So the next day I went to the line again to get some food and I felt something really close to me again and i felt a hand trying to pull my jumper and shirt and it made me very uncomfortable and he touched me in my legs and between them but I was scared I didn\u2019t know what to do I was just frozen I would always try in move but he would always go back, so again I got out of the line. I felt like he was following me everywhere I was really scared my friends were always there to make me feel a bit more protected. It happened for two weeks him just touching me and it always got worse, so I told my head of year but I couldn\u2019t describe what he was doing so it looked like she didn\u2019t really care so I thought I was being exaggerated that it was ok for him to touch me really inappropriately. I didn\u2019t eat at school for days, until one day I went and he was there and once again he touched but this time quite worse as he tried getting between legs again my friends saw so they went to get my head of year and she took him out of the line and I didn\u2019t know what she said to him she never spoke to me about it. The good thing is that he stopped but I was so traumatized and I still am. I have nightmares all the time and flashbacks of his face as I saw him earlier this year for the first time in a year I was scared I was getting paranoid.

I don\u2019t feel guilty or sorry for people and I knew it wasn\u2019t normal for a boy at the age of 7 to be obsessed with murder and crime and killers. I knew I had to adapt and not draw attention to myself. So I created what you could say an act, a fake person. A role I had to commit to in order to seem as though I conformed, that I fit in. However, as i got older, I began to become cold and bitter but had to hide it. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a psychopath or anything of the sorts. I do share some similar attributes, for example I\u2019m good at manipulating people, I\u2019m smarter than average and I suppose in some senses i am fairly narcissistic though it pains me to say. I also like to consider that the person I am around people is confident and charismatic. All of this I have become accustom to. It is day to day life for me now. But as I come\u00a0close to completing school, I realise that I\u2019m drawn to death. The idea of killing someone is about the only thing that interests me and even for me that is worrying.

He\u2019s threatened to kill himself numerous times and has held loaded guns to his head while screaming at me. He\u2019s even fired off a pistol into the ground right next to me while yelling. Another night, we both were drinking and went to bed late. I woke during the night and ran to the bathroom to vomit. He was angry that he had to come check on me and started to say nasty things. I began yelling at him asking what\u2019s wrong with him and banged my hands onto his chest as I did that. Well, he hauled off and punched me in the fa ce. I never reported this to the police. He\u2019s called me pathetic, said he has no respect for me and many other nasty things. This past May, he put a gun to his head again and that was it for me. I moved back to my town with plans of either selling the home we purchased together or him refinancing to have me removed. He still wouldn\u2019t let me go and I allowed it for some reason!!! We\u2019ve been seeing each other every other weekend since July (again, I\u2019m doing all the driving). He has been doing much better with not drinking but I have caught him lying about it because I can tell when he is. In November, he decided to get drunk again and we had another nasty fight. He apologized saying he would never do it again, that he does not like the person he becomes when he\u2019s drinking and that I should be treated like a queen. So, I gave him yet another chance. This past weekend, I asked if he got beer jokingly and he responded that he did but only a six pack. SMH! He then proceeded to tell me that he wanted to reach out to friends he cut ties with and when I asked if that was a good idea because they like to party, he got enraged! Called me all kinds of nasty things and was extremely hurtful. I told him I cannot do this anymore, that I deserve better and that he really needs to seek help from all the pain he has from childhood.

Sometimes crying, sometimes wanting to scream, nothing I do gets my mind off of it. No matter what i try to think about or do. Also my dreams lately have been very traumatizing, murders, blood, suicide, everything bad\u2026 started around the same time these flashbacks started happening. I have always dealt with my stress, or trauma. It\u2019s never affected me like this\u2026 I wake up legitimately fearful from my dreams, or I just can not sleep, when the flashbacks happen NOTHING gets my mind off them\u2026 I can\u2019t concentrate\u2026 what should I do? What does this sound like? Help me please? :(",

As a result, I have grown up to be very nervous, very shy, unable to trust others, unable to express love easily, unable to deal with negative thoughts or emotions in a productive fashion, afraid to be independent in the world, and constantly feel like I can\u2019t make something successful of myself. I wasn\u2019t always like this. I remember in my early childhood that I loved to socialize, explore the world, learn, I had dreams that I honestly thought I could reach. I was more positive, hopeful, and optimistic. Now, I feel as though all I ever feel is anger. I\u2019m so restless. I want to do something, have fun, grow up , stop being so shy, and improve as a person, but, I don\u2019t know where to start.

It\u2019s scaring me. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone. My parents have done so much for me, and I know they have tried their best at raising me, but, I can\u2019t help but blame them for how I turned out and feel angry at them.

She often thinks radio stations are made only for her and playing music that speaks only to her. She also has become convinced that someone has hacked her YouTube account and is purposefully playing certain songs to try to tell her something. She often claims to speak to people that have passed away but when you ask her if she means that she\u2019s spoken to a dead person, she says no only that these people are somehow in her head, but she knows they\u2019re actually dead. She has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis for the last ten years or so and I know that researchers have discovered a link between multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, so I figured it was certainly possible that she has it. She also has been diagnosed with depression and was taking medication to treat it for a time, but she has since quit taking that medication and all of her other medication. She also freaks out everytime there is a sudden noise and she\u2019s convinced that that\u2019s not normal at all and she becomes sort of scared like something is going to happen.

He has tried to leave her multiple times throughout their relationship, but she would threaten suicide in order to keep him around. A little bit about her: she suffers from childhood trauma. She had a very rough life growing up before she was adopted into my family. There is a history of schizophrenia, depression, and autism in her biological family tree. She is unreliable when it comes to committing to plans. She used to sleep all day, before the baby. She is never happy and if you make any mistakes, she will hold a grudge forever. She expects perfection from others, but will have excuses for herself. Since the age of twelve she has always had a boyfriend, I think her greatest fear is being single or alone. She is always angry or upset with him but will not let him go. A little bit about him: he is 3 years younger than her, he wants to be a twenty-something year old and hates being restricted by her. He has ADHD and chronic migraines, as well as a dysfunctional family. He has gotten to the point where he tries to reach out to other girls, or he tries to escape with friends. She goes through his phone every day AND SEES THAT HE IS TRYING TO CHEAT ON HER but will still not let him go. He has stopped doing household chores, he no longer helps take care of their child, he is trying to escape. If he is ever alone with the baby he tries to get others to watch her for him. He is always reaching out to me telling me how he does not love her, and how he wants to leave. I do not respond, but I predict that if he manages to leave, she will follow him. Or he is just venting to me and actually will not try to leave (because he\u2019s done that before). They are currently looking for a new place to move in to.

        "Patient Question": "My best friend and I are very different from each other but we have grown a very strong relationship over the years. She is a smart, highly educated, 32 year old virgin that I hardly think has ever even kissed someone. Myself, I have been in many relationships but am currently single, 32 years old as well. My friend has been growing as a person a lot over the last year, and in August she came to me and said she\u00b4d started dating someone she met online. I was very supportive that she started online dating, and thrilled that she wanted to go out for drinks, buy shoes with high heals, and I encouraged more social behaviour. She dated this guy for a few weeks and it ended. Then, about 6 weeks ago she called me at 00.30 on a Thursday night, asking if she could come over because she had something to tell me. I got a bit stressed thinking it must be serious, because it was so late, and because it could not wait. She told me that when she started dating that online-guy they had sex. He was her first, and they were not in love. Then she told me that she liked it rough and he could not give her what she wanted. She had therefore joined a sadomasochistic sex society, went to an information meeting and now attends meetings and parties. This just after having sex for the first time a few weeks earlier. She told me she didn\u2019t want to lie to me and wanted me to know what was going on, because we are so close and I know everything that is going on in her life. This particular night she came straight from a 45-year-old man she had had sex with. My friend and I have hardly ever talked about sex, I have even wondered that she might be a lesbian without knowing it herself yet. I was shocked to say the least. We live in a small city with 300 000 inhabitants, big enough to be anonymous, but still. I want her to experience love and sex, not sex as a mechanistic act. The days after her confession I felt confused and sad, kind of like I\u2019m losing her. Now she has a complete new side to her life that I cant share with her, and she has met so many new people. People of all sorts with a variety of sex-interests, some living in polygamist relationships. A lot that is new to me, but I wish to be open-minded. One week after the breaking news she attended a party and met a guy wearing latex clothes. Lets call him Alan. They jumped straight into a relationship, and one week after they first met, Alan and his friend joined my friend and I at a cabin trip (because he was going to Kuala Lumpur in a few days for work). He was rude to me and I did not like his attitude. He seems very emotionally unstable (I have a PhD in neuroscience), and recently got out of a 6-year relationship, just 2 months prior. He kept talking about his ex and how she being mentally ill had ruined their relationship. Apparently this ex-girlfriend grew up in several foster homes and was sexually abused, married a 25-year-older man that she left \u2013 including the children because she was an unfit mother. Later on it was revealed that this old father had abused the children too, and she got the custody back. Then she met Alan. Alan is dominant and my best friend likes to be dominated, apparently. I cant help but think that Alan sort of \u201cliked\u201d being with a damaged woman that he could help and further dominate. I don\u2019t know, but it bothers me how negatively he was talking about her. All matters have two sides. Now my friend talks about Alan constantly and is in love. She has already introduced him to her parents and some of our other friends. After only 5 weeks acquaintance. She really wants me to like him. However, I find it really hard to like him and her new lifestyle. I feel like I have lost her and that our friendship has changed forever. It makes me really sad, she has been such an important part of my life for so long. I feel like she has put a lot on me, the sex-club in itself will take some time to accept. However, introducing a man to me just a few days after the confession and expecting me to like him, is just too much. How should I react to this? I am trying to be happy for her, but in a way I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s quite possible that if I don\u2019t like this new guy I will lose my best friend. Should I just move on and accept that we have become too different now? I would really appreciate some thoughts about this, I have no-one I can discuss it with. (From Norway)",

I went from so happy with this guy to absolutely dreading the mention of his name, I don\u2019t want to see him anymore and every time he talks to me or texts me I feel nauseous. I don\u2019t understand why I have developed a hatred towards him when a couple of weeks ago I couldn\u2019t stop talking about him. This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. The last three relationships I was pretty much obsessed with these guys and then like a flip of a switch I become depressed and I developed a hatred towards them. However, once I break up with them it\u2019s like nothing ever happened and I instantly feel refreshed and back to normal.",

My kids being now 7,2, and 4 and my mom only going to two birthdays which was for the oldest and none for the others, even when we lived 30 minutes away. My sister lives a hour away and their was never a excuse for her. My sisters nor my mom calls me it is just me who does the work. It has been like this for a long time. My sister plans something everyone attends, I plan something a event of any kind I get excuses why they cant. I express to my sister my feelings she says im starting to pick a fight. I invited her to Thanksgiving she said she doesnt want to take her kid from her grandparents and her boyfriend kids away from their family. This has been going on to long time bringing me down for a long time. And I keep jumping in the ring for more punches.",

        "Patient Question": "Hi :) So I recently broke up with my boyfriend and best friend (two months ago). I am at rock bottom as I\u2019ve experienced rape, abuse, dropped out of college to pursue my ambitions but it\u2019s not working out. He was also going through a lot, a life changing surgery and recovery. He broke up with me because he felt that he needed to regain his strength alone before using his energy on a relationship and would like to meet up after he regained his confidence. I had accepted his decision and we remained best friends. He asked for space which hurt me as I need support during my trying times and I\u2019m getting support from my friends but not from him. He ignored my email when I explained how I felt. I feel like it\u2019s unacceptable to ignore someone at their worst as I was there for him at his worst. I don\u2019t know if I can forgive him for this. Am I overreacting? We were always great at communicating but now he refuses to reach out and ask how I\u2019m doing. He\u2019s not there for me at my worst so he doesn\u2019t deserve me at my best? Is this rational thinking? (From South Africa)",

        "Patient Question": "When I started my job at a grocery store 3 months ago I would have really bad anxiety. I was generally an anxious person before but being a social environment only made it worse. I\u2019m very bad with people and putting on that happy/cheery customer surface attitude. It got to a point at times I was choking back tears because I was so anxious. My sister did let me have some of her prescription anxiety medicine at first, which is know is wrong. I also took kava root and 5-HTP on top of that. I was more comfortable being really tired all day than being anxious. Since then, I have been self medicating with a supplement called Phenibut and on occasion 5-HTP on top of that. Phenibut is said to be effective for social anxiety and can help bring you out of your shell. I take the maximum serving size listed (which is roughly 1060mg). after I got used to it it has been very helpful. I\u2019m not intimidated by my male coworkers anymore, I am comfortable answering the phone and I can talk to customers without fear. This is something that works for me. Obviously there is no therapy attached to self-medication, but if it is effective, does that still make it wrong?",
